In this step, you'll configure your SSH settings to enable seamless access to platform systems.

## Overview

SSH configuration allows you to:
- Connect to platform systems without repeatedly entering keys
- Automatically use your SSH key
- Configure host-specific settings

## SSH Key Verification

First, verify your SSH key from Step 1 is still in place:

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You should see output showing your private key exists with `600` permissions.

## Configure SSH Config

Your SSH client needs configuration to know about your keys and hosts.

### Option A: Self-Service Script (Recommended)

[Link to setup repo script]

Run the script to generate your SSH config:

```bash
[command to run script]
```

This generates configuration from the template with your specific values.

### Option B: Manual Configuration Using Template

[Link to SSH config template in setup repo]

#### View Template

The setup repository includes a template file showing example SSH configuration:

```bash
cat [path-to-template]
```

#### Create Your SSH Config

1. Open or create: `~/.ssh/config`

   ```bash
   nano ~/.ssh/config
   ```

2. Add entries based on the template for each platform host:

   ```
   Host [host1-placeholder]
       HostName [hostname.example.com]
       User [your-username]
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       [Placeholder: additional host-specific settings]

   Host [host2-placeholder]
       HostName [hostname.example.com]
       User [your-username]
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
       [Placeholder: additional host-specific settings]
   ```

3. Set correct permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
   ```

## Verify SSH Configuration

Test your SSH configuration:

```bash
# Test connection to a platform host
ssh [host-placeholder]
```

If successful:
- [ ] You should connect without entering a password
- [ ] Your SSH key is automatically used
- [ ] You're authenticated to the remote system

If you receive a permission denied error, see troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you see "Permission denied (publickey)":

1. Verify your SSH key exists: `ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
2. Verify your public key is in your platform user configuration
3. Verify the host entry in `~/.ssh/config` matches the actual hostname
4. Check with Platform Operations that your user is in the correct access group

### Can't Connect to Host

If you see "Could not resolve hostname":

1. Verify your VPN is connected (from Step 7)
2. Verify DNS is configured correctly
3. Verify the hostname in your SSH config is correct
4. Try adding `-v` flag for verbose output: `ssh -v [host-placeholder]`

## Summary Checklist

- ✓ SSH key exists at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- ✓ SSH config created at `~/.ssh/config`
- ✓ SSH config permissions set to 600
- ✓ Can successfully SSH to platform hosts
