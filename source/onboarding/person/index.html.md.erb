## Azure AD groups

Access to most systems is granted by being added to Azure AD groups, you can join these by sending a pull request
and getting it approved by Platform Operations.

The file is [prod_users.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml).

To start with join these groups:

```yaml
- name: username
  groups:
  - DTS CFT Developers
  - <your-team-group> # check other team members to find the group
```

Where `username` is the part of your email before @ (usually firstname.lastname like john.smith),
`justice.gov.uk` users need to include their full email, e.g. `mary.jayne@justice.gov.uk`.

These groups will give you access to the VPN, LaunchDarkly, the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and logs.


## GitHub

Read the [acceptable use policy](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RPE/Acceptable+Use+Policy+and+Contractor+Security+Guidance).
If you agree to follow it then ask someone in your team who has access to add you in the [GitHub management](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management) repository by submitting a pull request.

GitHub teams are managed by your Technical Lead or a senior member of the team, ask them to add you to any team groups.

Once you've joined GitHub make sure you add your user to the [Slack -> GitHub mapping](https://github.com/hmcts/github-slack-user-mappings)

## Office 365
 
You should have your Office 365 team through the Jira onboarding process, but ask your team lead to add you to any email groups.
Often there's a `$team-developers@hmcts.net` and a `$team@hmcts.net` group.
