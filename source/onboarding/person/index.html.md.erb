## Azure AD groups

Azure AD is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions and resources in Azure.
When your Azure AD user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.

As GitHub access is also provided by adding an Azure AD Group, an existing teammate should create a pull request
to [devops-azure-ad](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml) and get it approved by Platform Operations.

The first user in a team should raise a [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help) request with the required groups.

To start with send the [acceptable use policy](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RPE/Acceptable+Use+Policy+and+Contractor+Security+Guidance) to the new starter.

Then add these groups:

```yaml
# username is the part of the email before @ for hmcts.net users, e.g. mary.jayne
# for justice.gov.uk users it's the full email, e.g. mary.jayne@justice.gov.uk
- name: username
  groups:
  - DTS CFT Developers # or if you're working on SDS 'DTS SDS Developers', if you only need access to GitHub you can skip this
  - DTS GitHub Access # if you need access to GitHub
  - <your-team-group> # check other team members to find the group
```

These groups will give you access to:

- [VPN](https://portal.platform.hmcts.net)
- [LaunchDarkly](/cloud-native-platform/new-component/feature-flags.html#accessing-launchdarkly)
- the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
- application logs
- [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/hmcts/sso)

## GitHub

Once you've joined the `DTS GitHub Access` AzureAD group you will be able to join GitHub from your [myapps.microsoft.com](https://myapps.microsoft.com/hmcts.net) dashboard.

GitHub teams are managed either by being [linked to a team Azure AD group](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group)
or by or a senior member of the team, ask them to add you to any team groups.

Once you've joined GitHub make sure you add your user to the [Slack -> GitHub mapping](https://github.com/hmcts/github-slack-user-mappings).

## Deploying your first application

It's highly encouraged that all new Software Engineers deploy their first application now.

We're creating a set of guides known as the 'Golden path' to help you do this.

The purpose of these guides is:

> The Golden Path is the opinionated and supported path to build your system and the Golden Path tutorial walks you through this path

The two available tutorials will guide you through deploying your first Java or Node.js application and will help you make your first change to it:

- [Golden path - Java](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs/default/component/golden-path-java)
- [Golden path - Node.js](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs/default/component/golden-path-nodejs)

## Office 365

You should have your Office 365 team through the JIRA onboarding process, but ask your team lead to add you to any email groups.
Often there's a `$team-developers@hmcts.net` and a `$team@hmcts.net` group.

## Docker Business Licence

In order to use Docker Desktop at HMCTS you need to have a business license, this is linked to your Docker Hub account. Docker Hub isn't really used apart from for assigning licenses.

Docker Desktop version 4.4.0 and above will redirect you to a web browser to sign in via single sign on by entering your HMCTS email address.

To use the docker cli with your account, you will need to set up a Personal Authentication Token (PAT). See [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) for how to create a PAT.

You must be in one of the following groups:

- DTS Platform Operations
- DTS CFT Developers
- DTS SDS Developers
- DTS Docker Hub
