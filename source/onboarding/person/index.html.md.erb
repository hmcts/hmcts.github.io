## Azure AD groups

Azure AD is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions and resources in Azure.
When your GitHub user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.

Access to most systems is granted by being added to Azure AD groups, you can join these by sending a pull request
and getting it approved by Platform Operations.

The file is [prod_users.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml).

To start with join these groups:

```yaml
- name: username
  groups:
  - DTS CFT Developers
  - <your-team-group> # check other team members to find the group
```

Where `username` is the part of your email before @ (usually firstname.lastname like john.smith),
`justice.gov.uk` users need to include their full email, e.g. `mary.jayne@justice.gov.uk`.

These groups will give you access to the VPN, LaunchDarkly, the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and logs.


## GitHub

Read the [acceptable use policy](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RPE/Acceptable+Use+Policy+and+Contractor+Security+Guidance).
If you agree to follow it then ask someone in your team who has access to add you in the [GitHub management](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management) repository by submitting a pull request.

GitHub teams are managed by your Technical Lead or a senior member of the team, ask them to add you to any team groups.

Once you've joined GitHub make sure you add your user to the [Slack -> GitHub mapping](https://github.com/hmcts/github-slack-user-mappings).

## Deploying your first application

It's highly encouraged that all new Software Engineers deploy their first application now.

We're creating a set of guides known as the 'Golden path' to help you do this.

The purpose of these guides is:

> The Golden Path is the opinionated and supported path to build your system and the Golden Path tutorial walks you through this path

The two available tutorials will guide you through deploying your first Java or Node.js application and will help you make your first change to it:

- [Golden path - Java](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs/default/component/golden-path-java)
- [Golden path - Node.js](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/docs/default/component/golden-path-nodejs)

## Office 365
 
You should have your Office 365 team through the Jira onboarding process, but ask your team lead to add you to any email groups.
Often there's a `$team-developers@hmcts.net` and a `$team@hmcts.net` group.

## Docker Business Licence

In order to use Docker Desktop at HMCTS you need to have a business license, this is linked to your Docker Hub account. Docker Hub isn't really used apart from for assigning licenses.

Docker Desktop version 4.4.0 and above will redirect you to a web browser to sign in via single sign on by entering your HMCTS email address.

To use the docker cli with your account, you will need to set up a Personal Authentication Token (PAT). See [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) for how to create a PAT.

You must be in one of the following groups:

- DTS Platform Operations
- DTS CFT Developers
- DTS SDS Developers
- DTS Docker Hub

## Kubernetes
In order to connect to kubernetes clusters in AKS you need to install azure client and kubectl:

Install the Azure Client on your machine. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

Setup the client using `az login`.
Set your current working subscription with `az account set --subscription DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-DEV`

Install the Kubernetes Client on your machine. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools

Get credentials for the AKS cluster you are working with `az aks get-credentials --resource-group ss-dev-00-rg --name ss-dev-00-aks`

You can now view pods using kubectl in the mi namespace, for example `kubectl get pods -n mi -o wide`

Contact #platops-help on slack for any support.
