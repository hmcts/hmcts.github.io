Join the following 

- Azure AD groups - submit pull request to the [Azure AD repository](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml)

```yaml
- name: username
  groups:
  - DTS CFT Developers
  - <your-team-group> # check other team members to find the group
```

Where `username` is the part of your email before @ (usually firstname.lastname like john.smith),
`justice.gov.uk` users need to include their full email, e.g. `mary.jayne@justice.gov.uk`.

These groups will give you access to the VPN, the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and logs.
