## Azure AD groups

Azure AD is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions and resources in Azure.
When your GitHub user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.

Access to most systems is granted by being added to Azure AD groups, you can join these by sending a pull request
and getting it approved by Platform Operations.

The file is [prod_users.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml).

To start with join these groups:

```yaml
- name: username
  groups:
  - DTS CFT Developers
  - <your-team-group> # check other team members to find the group
```

Where `username` is the part of your email before @ (usually firstname.lastname like john.smith),
`justice.gov.uk` users need to include their full email, e.g. `mary.jayne@justice.gov.uk`.

These groups will give you access to the VPN, LaunchDarkly, the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and logs.


## GitHub

Read the [acceptable use policy](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RPE/Acceptable+Use+Policy+and+Contractor+Security+Guidance).
If you agree to follow it then ask someone in your team who has access to add you in the [GitHub management](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management) repository by submitting a pull request.

GitHub teams are managed by your Technical Lead or a senior member of the team, ask them to add you to any team groups.

Once you've joined GitHub make sure you add your user to the [Slack -> GitHub mapping](https://github.com/hmcts/github-slack-user-mappings)

## Office 365
 
You should have your Office 365 team through the Jira onboarding process, but ask your team lead to add you to any email groups.
Often there's a `$team-developers@hmcts.net` and a `$team@hmcts.net` group.

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is configured to use single sign on with Azure AD. Sign into [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/login) and specify your HMCTS email address. You will be redirected to the Microsoft 365 login page.

Docker Desktop version 4.4.0 and above will redirect you to a web browser to sign in, where you can enter follow the same procedure.

To use the docker cli with your account, you will need to set up a Personal Authentication Token (PAT). See [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) for how to create a PAT.

You must be in one of the following groups:

- DTS Platform Operations
- DTS CFT Developers
- DTS SDS Developers
- DTS Docker Hub
