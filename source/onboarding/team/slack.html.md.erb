Once you've received your `hmcts.net` or `justice.gov.uk` email account you can self service sign-up to our slack workspace.

Visit [hmcts-reform.slack.com](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/) and click `create an account`

After you've created your account please make sure to fill out your profile,
set at least your full name, and in the what I do section put your team name and role.

Now that you've got a slack account you'll need to create a couple of channels:

- a team contact channel, this must be public as this is where people on other teams will come to contact you,
  this is often your regular developer chat channel, i.e. `team-dev` or `team-tech`.
- a build notices channel, this should be public as there's no reason to hide your build failures.

Once you've created a build notices channel you will need to invite our 'Jenkins' bot user into the channel.

```shell
/invite @Jenkins
```

Make sure you pick the Jenkins \[app] user:
