Once you've received your `hmcts.net` or `justice.gov.uk` email account you can be invited into our Slack workspace by one of your team members.

Most teams use the [hmcts-reform.slack.com](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/) workspace.

After you've created your account please make sure to fill out your profile,
set at least your full name, and in the what I do section put your team name and role.

Now that you've got a slack account you'll need to create a couple of channels:

- a team contact channel, this must be public as this is where people on other teams will come to contact you,
  this is often your regular developer chat channel, i.e. `team-dev` or `team-tech`.
- a build notices channel, this should be public as there's no reason to hide your build failures.

Once you've created a build notices channel you will need to invite our 'Jenkins' bot user into the channel.

```shell
/invite @Jenkins
```

Make sure you pick the Jenkins \[app] user:

## Troubleshooting

### I have a hmcts.net account and can't sign up to an account

This can happen if your Slack invite was approved invite but you haven't been added to the SSO exclusion list.
Get someone in your team to ask in the #pls-admins channel to check on your account.
