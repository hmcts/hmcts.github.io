## Slack

Once you've received your `hmcts.net` or `justice.gov.uk` email account you can self service sign-up to our slack workspace.

Visit [hmcts-reform.slack.com](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/) and click `create an account`

After you've created your account please make sure to fill out your profile,
set at least your full name, and in the what I do section put your team name and role.

Now that you've got a slack account you'll need to create a couple of channels:

- a team contact channel, this must be public as this is where people on other teams will come to contact you,
  this is often your regular developer chat channel, i.e. `team-dev` or `team-tech`.
- a build notices channel, this should be public as there's no reason to hide your build failures.

Once you've created a build notices channel you will need to invite our 'Jenkins' bot user into the channel.

```shell
/invite @Jenkins
```

Make sure you pick the Jenkins \[app] user:

## Github config

### Access

Once you've received your `hmcts.net` or `justice.gov.uk` email account and `Confluence` access, you can request GitHub access in one of two ways:

1. If someone in your team already has access then ask them to follow the instructions in the [GitHub management](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management) repository to add you.
2. If you're the first person in your team you should raise a help request in [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/archives/C8SR5CAMU), asking for GitHub access, you need to provide your GitHub username and say that you agree to the [Acceptable Use Policy](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RPE/Acceptable+Use+Policy+and+Contractor+Security+Guidance).

You should receive an email inviting you to the GitHub organisation, visit [https://github.com/hmcts](https://github.com/hmcts) to accept the invite.

### GitHub Teams

Now you need to create two 'GitHub teams' for your team.

1. Click on the 'teams' tab
2. Create a team called \<team-name>
3. Create a team called \<team-name>-admins

see also [creating a GitHub repository](/ways-of-working/new-component/github-repo.html#create-a-github-repository).

### Team metadata required for pipelines

Each team needs to add configuration for their team to the [team-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/blob/master/team-config.yml) file</a>
in the cnp-jenkins-config repository.

Please send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your configuration.

All fields are mandatory, 

Copy another teams config and adjust to meet your needs.

```yaml
sscs: # product name in Jenkinsfile_CNP, this will be a 'short name' that your team is known by
  team: "SSCS" # team 'display name', useful for longer more recognisable names for tagging
  namespace: "sscs" # Kubernetes namespace, usually the same as your 'product name'
  slack:
    contact_channel: "#sscs-tech" # public channel that you can be contacted at
    build_notices_channel: "#sscs-tech" # all build notices will be sent here
```

Make sure your product name is not too long as some Azure resources have constraints on their length 
which can easily be hit if names are too long.

## Jenkins org setup

There are Jenkins servers for: CFT (Civil, Family & Tribunal) and SDS (Shared Digital Services)

To set up a Jenkins pipeline integration with your GitHub repo, you will need to create an organisation within Jenkins.

The steps to be followed below depend on what business area your application is in.

If your application is in CFT, see Step 1. If your application is in SDS, skip to Step 4.

 1. Jenkins uses GitHub App Authentication, Request on [#platops-help] (https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help) to add a [Github app for your Jenkins Org](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/github-app.adoc#github-app-authentication-guide).

 2. Please give permissions based on an [existing Github App](https://github.com/organizations/hmcts/settings/apps/hmcts-jenkins-rpe) as we give additional permissions to what is listed in the plugin's documentation (only GitHub app maintainers can see this).
 3. Platform Operations will store the private key of app secrets to keyvault and [add credentials to Jenkins](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/2148/files) .
    
    ```bash
    TEAM_NAME=$1
    az keyvault secret set -n  hmcts-jenkins-${TEAM_NAME}-ghapp -f converted-github-app.pem --vault-name cftptl-intsvc
    az keyvault secret set -n  hmcts-jenkins-${TEAM_NAME}-ghapp -f converted-github-app.pem --vault-name cftsbox-intsvc
    ```
 4. Add your organisation config.

    CFT: [cnp-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/pull/402)

    SDS: [sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/pull/1)
 5. Add a Jenkins build dashboard.

    CFT: [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7221)

    SDS: [shared-services-flux](https://github.com/hmcts/shared-services-flux/blob/a615723ac7b8e814be9f0eae78c580fddd84539c/k8s/namespaces/jenkins/patches/ptl/cluster-00/jenkins.yaml#L114)
 6. Scan the organisation manually on Jenkins if it doesn't scan automatically.

## Azure Active Directory (AAD) groups

Create a help request in the [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/messages/platops-help) channel on Slack.

Description:

> Hi
> I have just started on the "team name" team,

> Can you please create the a team AAD group: "DTS Team name"

To join the groups send a pull request to the [devops-azure-aad](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/prod_users.yml) git repository.

## Create Office 365 team group

It is recommended that you create an office 365 group for your team and depending on size possibly one for your dev team as well.

See the Microsoft documentation for [how to create a group](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-group-in-outlook-04d0c9cf-6864-423c-a380-4fa858f27102#ID0EACAAA=Web).
