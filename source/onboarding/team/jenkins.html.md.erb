There are Jenkins servers for both CFT (Civil, Family & Tribunal) and SDS (Shared Digital Services)

To set up a Jenkins pipeline integration with your GitHub repo, you will need to create an organisation within Jenkins.

The steps to be followed below depend on what business area your application is in.

 1. Add your organisation config.

    CFT: [cnp-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/pull/402)

    SDS: [sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/blob/master/jobdsl/organisations.groovy#L17)

 2. Add a Jenkins build dashboard.

    CFT: [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7221)

    SDS: [sds-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/blob/master/k8s/namespaces/jenkins/patches/ptl/cluster-00/jenkins.yaml#L140)

 3. Add the [required GitHub topic](#github-topics) to the repository.

 4. Scan the organisation manually on Jenkins if it doesn't scan automatically.

 5. To allow Jenkins to deploy to production, you must add your GitHub repository to this list of approved repositories:

    CFT: [hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/environment-approvals.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/blob/master/environment-approvals.yml)

    SDS: [hmcts/sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/blob/master/environment-approvals.yml)

## GitHub topics

Jenkins looks for repositories by searching for GitHub topics.

The topics are named after the Jenkins instance the repository will be built on and on CFT they are split alphabetically
in a balanced split (most teams are before 'j' in the alphabet).

e.g. if your repository starts with `div` you look for where 'd' is in the topics, in CFT this would be `jenkins-cft-d-i`.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository)
on how to add a topic.

### CFT Topics

- `jenkins-cft-a-c`
- `jenkins-cft-d-i`
- `jenkins-cft-j-z`

### SDS Topics

SDS repositories are not currently split, but they may be in the future.

- `jenkins-sds`
