There are Jenkins servers for: CFT (Civil, Family & Tribunal) and SDS (Shared Digital Services)

To set up a Jenkins pipeline integration with your GitHub repo, you will need to create an organisation within Jenkins.

The steps to be followed below depend on what business area your application is in.

 1. Add your organisation config.

    CFT: [cnp-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/pull/402)

    SDS: [sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/pull/1)
 2. Add a Jenkins build dashboard.

    CFT: [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7221)

    SDS: [shared-services-flux](https://github.com/hmcts/shared-services-flux/blob/a615723ac7b8e814be9f0eae78c580fddd84539c/k8s/namespaces/jenkins/patches/ptl/cluster-00/jenkins.yaml#L114)
 3. Scan the organisation manually on Jenkins if it doesn't scan automatically.
