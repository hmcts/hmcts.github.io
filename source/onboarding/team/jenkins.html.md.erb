There are Jenkins servers for: CFT (Civil, Family & Tribunal) and SDS (Shared Digital Services)

To set up a Jenkins pipeline integration with your GitHub repo, you will need to create an organisation within Jenkins.

The steps to be followed below depend on what business area your application is in.

If your application is in CFT, see Step 1. If your application is in SDS, skip to Step 4.

 1. Jenkins uses GitHub App Authentication, Request on [#platops-help] (https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help) to add a [Github app for your Jenkins Org](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-branch-source-plugin/blob/master/docs/github-app.adoc#github-app-authentication-guide).

 2. Please give permissions based on an [existing Github App](https://github.com/organizations/hmcts/settings/apps/hmcts-jenkins-rpe) as we give additional permissions to what is listed in the plugin's documentation (only GitHub app maintainers can see this).
 3. Platform Operations will store the private key of app secrets to Key Vault and [add credentials to Jenkins](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/2148/files) .

    ```bash
    TEAM_NAME=$1
    az keyvault secret set -n  hmcts-jenkins-${TEAM_NAME}-ghapp -f converted-github-app.pem --vault-name cftptl-intsvc
    az keyvault secret set -n  hmcts-jenkins-${TEAM_NAME}-ghapp -f converted-github-app.pem --vault-name cftsbox-intsvc
    ```
 4. Add your organisation config.

    CFT: [cnp-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/pull/402)

    SDS: [sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/pull/1)
 5. Add a Jenkins build dashboard.

    CFT: [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7221)

    SDS: [shared-services-flux](https://github.com/hmcts/shared-services-flux/blob/a615723ac7b8e814be9f0eae78c580fddd84539c/k8s/namespaces/jenkins/patches/ptl/cluster-00/jenkins.yaml#L114)
 6. Scan the organisation manually on Jenkins if it doesn't scan automatically.
