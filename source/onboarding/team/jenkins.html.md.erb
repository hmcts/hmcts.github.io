There are Jenkins servers for both CFT (Civil, Family & Tribunal) and SDS (Shared Digital Services)

To set up a Jenkins pipeline integration with your GitHub repo, you will need to create an organisation within Jenkins.

The steps to be followed below depend on what business area your application is in.

 1. Add your organisation config.

    CFT: [cnp-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/pull/402)

    SDS: [sds-jenkins-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/blob/master/jobdsl/organisations.groovy#L17)

 2. Add a Jenkins build dashboard.

    CFT: [cnp-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7221)

    SDS: [sds-flux-config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/blob/master/k8s/namespaces/jenkins/patches/ptl/cluster-00/jenkins.yaml#L140)

 3. Scan the organisation manually on Jenkins if it doesn't scan automatically.

 4. To allow Jenkins to deploy to production, you must Add your GitHub repo to this list of approved repos
