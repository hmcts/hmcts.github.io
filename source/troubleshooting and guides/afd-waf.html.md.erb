When testing through the Azure Frontdoor you may be presented with an error page saying 'The request is blocked', which normally results in being a Web Application Firewall(WAF) rule being blocked.

## Investigate

You can find out what the blocked rule is by following these steps:

1. Go to the spective Azure Frontdoor `hmcts-{env}` for CFT and `sdshmcts-{env}` for SDS. [Azure Frontdoors](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/microsoft.cdn%2Fprofiles)
2. Go down the side menu to `Monitoring > Logs`
3. Go to the query and add the query below, updating `{Request URL}` with the URL you are requesting. example `toffee.aat.platform.hmcts.net` <br/><br/>
```
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.NETWORK" and Category == "FrontdoorAccessLog" and requestUri_s contains "{Request URL}"
```
4. You can change the `Time range` to scope the search down.

For more information you can look at the [Azure Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-monitor?pivots=front-door-standard-premium#logs-and-diagnostics)

## Exclude Rules

If you need to allow this block through then you can update the exclusion rules for your frontdoor configuration following the [Azure Platform Terraform ReadMe](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform#WAF-Exclusions)
