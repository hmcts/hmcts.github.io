This page describes how to expose a new Virtual Network to the HMCTS VPN.
To do this you will need to setup network peering between the VPN and your Virtual Network.
Your project will need to be managed by Terraform to set this up.

This is an example of the Terraform used to [setup peering between two Vnets](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-sds-deploy/blob/0061d448847a7a16154ae3a23772c4e9a57587f1/components/01-network/21-peering.tf#L82-L104).

The destination Virtual Network details are:

- vnet name: `core-infra-vnet-mgmt`
- subscription id: `ed302caf-ec27-4c64-a05e-85731c3ce90e`
- vnet resource group: `rg-mgmt`
- net subscription: `Reform-CFT-Mgmt`

Once this is setup and deployed, you can then make a request to the Platform Operations team in [\#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help).  Raise a new request using the 'Help request with plato' shortcut, which will automatically raise a ticket for you and all messages will be synced to JIRA.

Raise a request to add the Address Space for your Vnet or Virtual Machine with what ports to whitelist, please include:

- Network name:
- IP Range:
- Ports to allow: 443 (sometimes 80, 22 as well)
