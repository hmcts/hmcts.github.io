- By Default, all developers have read access to non-prod AKS clusters and slightly higher privileges to their namespaces.
- You can connect to AKS clusters using `az aks get-credentials`. Below are some handy commands:

<%= partial 'clusters' %>

Once you have logged in, you can switch between clusters using [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) or below kubectl commands:

```shell
kubectl config use-context cft-perftest-00-aks
kubectl config use-context cft-aat-00-aks
```
