* [Adding a new user on GitHub](#adding-a-new-user-on-github)
* [Creating a new GitHub repository](#creating-a-new-github-repository)
* [Access to GitHub Repo](#access-to-github-repo)

## Adding a new user on GitHub

 - See [GitHub Onboarding](/cloud-native-platform/onboarding/team/github.html#access) for how to get access
 - Make sure the user has accepted the invite received on the email setup in Github or by visiting [github.com/hmcts](https://github.com/hmcts).

## Creating a new GitHub repository

See [create a GitHub repository](../new-component/github-repo.html#)

## Access to GitHub Repo

 - All repositories should be administered by the team who owns it.
 - Access should be managed through GitHub teams and not individuals.
 - If no one from your team have access, follow [asking for help](/cloud-native-platform/asking-for-help/#asking-for-help) to request org admins in one of the community/ support channels.
