## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the shutter solution design and its end to end implementation.

## Solution

![Shutter Solution Design Docs](/images/shutter_solution_static_webapp.png)

## Default shutter page
By default the following shutter page is used as per the GOV.UK patterns [service-unavailable-pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/service-unavailable-pages/)


## Implementation and Customization
Creating and Enabling the shutter solution for an application is a 3 step process as outlined below:

- By default, all applications are provisioned with an `Azure Static Web App`. If you wish to exclude this feature, you can set the value of [shutter_app](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/697bea554cad5b19f5e822b859fd3a86b32e4ce3/environments/prod/prod.tfvars#L2316) to `false`.
- To upload static content to an Azure Web App, you can use the repository named [azure-shutter-pages](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-shutter-pages).
- Enable shutter with a DNS swap


### Enable shutter with a DNS swap
Now everything is setup to render shutter page. Swap the DNS from Azure FrontDoor to Azure Static Web App endpoint with the following steps

- Clone the [azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository
- Lets assume this application need to be shuttered `www.decree-absolute.apply-divorce.service.gov.uk`
- Create a PR with the appropriate [prod zone](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/blob/a24128ffdc47687937cbab37aaa46040786c7955/environments/prod/apply-divorce-service-gov-uk.yml#L41)
- The above contents will be updated as follows:

```
- name: "www.decree-absolute"
  ttl: 300
  record: "hmcts-prod.azurefd.net"
  shutter: true
```

`shutter: true` will enable the shutter page and redirect all the traffic to Azure CDN.
`shutter: false` will disable the shutter page and redirect all the traffic back to Azure Frontdoor.
