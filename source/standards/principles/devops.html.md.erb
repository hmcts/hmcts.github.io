DevOps is not a job title. It's a culture. It is not just about infrastructure. It's about the people, processes, and tools that make it all work.

### Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure should be provisioned from code. This allows for the infrastructure to be versioned, tested, and deployed. It also allows for the infrastructure to be easily recreated in the event of a disaster.

### You build it, you run it

Delivery team's should be responsible for their own infrastructure. This means team's should be able to troubleshoot and fix issues with the infrastructure.

Applications should be run, monitored and scaled by the team that built it.

### Automate everything

Everything should be automated. This includes provisioning, configuration, deployment, and monitoring.

### Containers

Use containers to package applications. This allows for applications to be easily deployed and scaled.
