Citizen frontend applications should be built using a node.js based Server Side Rendering (SSR) framework such as Express.

Professional frontend applications should be built using a node.js based Single Page Application (SPA) framework such as Angular.

Both citizen and professional applications should be based on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and use
[GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/) or a derivative such as [HMCTS Frontend](https://hmcts.github.io/hmcts-frontend/).

### Node.js

Use the current LTS version. Ensure that there is a process in place to upgrade it as new versions released.

Deno is not currently recommended.

### Dependency management

Ensure dependabot or renovate has been configured to ensure that dependencies are kept up to date.

NPM or Yarn is acceptable.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is recommended for all new projects.

### Browser support

Applications should support the latest version of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.

Where possible applications should aim to use a responsive layout in order to work on mobile devices.

### Code style

Use an opinionated code linter such as eslint and code formatter such as prettier to eliminate discussions about subjective coding preferences.

### Accessibility

Use Pa11y for accessibility testing to WCAG 2.1 AA.

### Cross-browser and UI testing

Use playwright or cypress to test applications in the browser.

### Security

Configure the Content Security Policy headers to prevent XSS attacks.

Add CSRF protection to forms to ensure that they cannot be submitted by a third party.
