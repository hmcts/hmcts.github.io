### Automate

Ensure that SSL certificates are automated and renewed regularly.

Use services such as [Microsoft managed certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https#option-1-default-use-a-certificate-managed-by-front-door) or [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automate the process of obtaining and renewing SSL certificates.

### TLS

Use TLS 1.3 with a 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECDSA key.

Do not use TLS 1.0 or 1.1.
