APIs should be written using Java, preferably with an industry standard framework such.

### Java

Use the current LTS version. Ensure that there is a process in place to upgrade it as new versions released.

### Dependency management

Ensure dependabot or renovate has been configured so that dependencies are kept up to date.

### Build tools

Use gradle or maven to build the application. Ant is not recommended.

### Code style

Use the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) or a derivative.

Set up tooling to enforce coding standards such as checkstyle or spotless.

### Security

Use [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for dependency scanning.

### Documentation

Use [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) for API documentation.

Using JavaDoc is not necessary.

Documentation should not explain what the code is doing, but can be used to clarify why it is doing it.
