Follow the guidance in the [Technical Guidance Library](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DACS/C.4e+Cookie+Consent).

- Collect user consent explicitly before storing cookies on a user's device
  - Inform users about our data collection activities before cookies are set
  - Provide an option to choose whether users allow them or not
- Clearly state the cookie categories and their purpose
- Block all non-exempt cookies and scripts from being run until after the consent is given by the user
  - If the userâ€™s device is not running JavaScript, display a version of the cookie banner which tells them what to do in order to set or change their cookie preferences. Do not set any non-essential cookies, because the user has not consented to them
- Provide a link in the banner to a more detailed cookie policy

Use the [HMCTS Cookie Manager library](https://github.com/hmcts/cookie-manager) to manage consent.

### Cookie options

- Secure - in production ensure `Secure` is set
- SameSite - use `Strict` unless you need `Lax` for an [Oauth implementation](https://github.com/simov/grant/issues/199),
- HttpOnly - set to true unless you need to access the cookie from JavaScript
- Domain - do not set the domain unless you need to share the cookie across subdomains
