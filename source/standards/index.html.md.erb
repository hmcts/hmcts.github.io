# Principles, practices and standards

DTS define the principles, practices and standards that apply to all digital services in HMCTS. Principles are abstract
ideas and values which DTS holds independent of the specific area of the business. For example, Crime and CFT may have
different Practices or Standards in areas but they hold the same shared Principles.
