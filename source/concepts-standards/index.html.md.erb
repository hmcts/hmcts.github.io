Standards are a low level specification of how a particular technology should be used. Where possible, standards should be implemented through tooling and libraries rather than documentation.


# Principles, practices and standards

DTS define the principles, practices and standards that apply to all digital services in HMCTS. Principles are abstract
ideas and values which DTS holds independent of the specific area of the business. For example, Crime and CFT may have
different Practices or Standards in areas but they hold the same shared Principles.

### Principles

Principles are high level concepts that are used to guide the design of the system. They are not specific to any particular component or feature, and can be applied in a broad manner.

### Practices

Practices are concepts that are applicable within specific contexts such as a particular language, framework, or technology.

### Standards

Standards are a low level specification of how a particular technology should be used. Where possible, standards should be implemented through tooling and libraries rather than documentation.
