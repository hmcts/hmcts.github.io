This guide will give a broad overview of HMCTS, it's different programmes and technical platforms.

Each platform has it's own section for onboarding teams and people, as well as information on how to use the
platform.

The [Engineering standards](standards/index.html) cover the principles, practices and standards that apply to all
Engineering teams within HMCTS. Each team within HMCTS may have additional standards that apply specifically to
them.

Although there are many different programming languages and technologies used within HMCTS, new applications should
use the [recommended technology stack](/standards/technology-stack/index.html).

Before diving into each platform, it's worth getting an [overview of HMCTS](/hmcts-overview/) and
understanding each of the different business units.
