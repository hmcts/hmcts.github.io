# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The CJS Common Platform is a system that has been built from a Domain Driven Design first perspective.

There are a number of [context maps](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DDD/Common+Platform+Context+Map)* that
give an overview of the different contexts within the system.

New joiners should read and follow the [onboarding](onboarding/index.html) process to obtain access.

*\* Note: placeholder - content on confluence is yet to be created.*
