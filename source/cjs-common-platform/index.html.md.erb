The CJS Common Platform is a system that has been built from a Domain Driven Design first perspective.

There are a number of [context maps](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/DDD/Common+Platform+Context+Map) that
give an overview of the different contexts within the system.

New joiners should read the [introductory information](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=204745641&__ncforminfo=IUucwuCmUvrfgNuqzTNJ-U3V0HeZx3W7b60px4rg6njmy8UCGmRCEaqvAZWoDNDpOocRs28Tqc4nkYkbrujXpe0G9z6nUqym)
and [onboarding guide](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/CPPDEV/New+Joiners+-+Onboarding) to get started.
