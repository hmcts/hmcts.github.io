## Validation Tests

### Test 1: VPN Connection

**Objective:** Verify your VPN client can connect

1. Open Tunnelblick (or your VPN client)
2. Select your VPN configuration
3. Click "Connect"
4. Wait for connection status to show "Connected"

**Expected result:** ✓ Connected within [X seconds]

**If this fails:**
- Verify dnsmasq is running: `brew services list | grep dnsmasq`
- Verify DNS is configured in System Preferences
- Check VPN configuration file syntax
- Post error in [#slack-channel-placeholder]

### Test 2: Access Gerrit (Code Review System)

**Objective:** Verify you can access the code review platform

1. Ensure VPN is connected
2. Navigate to [Placeholder: Gerrit URL]
3. You should see Gerrit interface with "Sign in" option
4. Sign in with [Placeholder: credentials/method]

**Expected result:** ✓ Successfully authenticated to Gerrit

**If this fails:**
- Verify VPN is connected
- Verify your user account has Gerrit access permissions
- Check that you're in the correct access group
- Contact Platform Operations

### Test 3: Access Jenkins

**Objective:** Verify you can access the CI/CD system

1. Ensure VPN is connected
2. Navigate to [Placeholder: Jenkins URL]
3. You should see Jenkins interface
4. Sign in with [Placeholder: credentials/method]

**Expected result:** ✓ Successfully authenticated to Jenkins

**If this fails:**
- Verify VPN is connected
- Verify your user account has Jenkins access
- Check that you're in the correct access group
- Contact Platform Operations

### Test 4: SSH Connection

**Objective:** Verify you can SSH to platform systems

**Prerequisite:** You must be a member of the appropriate SSH access group. If this test fails, it may be due to group membership, not configuration issues.

```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh [host-placeholder]
```

**Expected result:** ✓ Successfully connected to remote system

If you see a prompt or command output, you've successfully authenticated.

<details>
<summary>📋 View verbose SSH troubleshooting</summary>

If SSH fails, run with verbose output:

```bash
ssh -v [host-placeholder]
```

This shows detailed connection information. Look for:
- "Trying to connect to..." - shows name resolution working
- "Permission denied (publickey)" - your key wasn't accepted
- "Could not resolve hostname" - DNS issue (check Step 7)

</details>

**If this fails:**
- Verify your SSH key exists: `ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Verify SSH config is correct: `cat ~/.ssh/config`
- Verify your public SSH key is in user configuration
- Verify you're a member of SSH access group
- Contact Platform Operations

### Test 5: Google Authenticator

**Objective:** Verify your authenticator is working

1. Open your authenticator app
2. Find your Crime Platform account
3. Verify a 6-digit code is displayed
4. Verify the code changes approximately every 30 seconds

**Expected result:** ✓ Code is displayed and rotates every 30 seconds

**If this fails:**
- Verify you added the secret correctly
- Verify your device time is synchronized (important for TOTP)
- Try re-adding the secret from Step 9
- Contact Platform Operations
