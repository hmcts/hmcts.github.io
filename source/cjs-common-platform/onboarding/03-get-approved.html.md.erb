Once your Pull Request is created, the Platform Operations team will be notified and should review and approve your access request shortly.

### Slack Channel

If your PR is not reviewed within a reasonable time you can also post a message with a link in the [Platops Code Review Slack channel](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C034HQ2RDR8).

### Merge the PR

Once your Pull Request has been approved by a member of the Platform Operations team, you can proceed to merge it into the main branch.  
This should automatically trigger a run of an ADO pipeline to provision your access.*

*\* - Automatic trigger is still work in progress, in the meantime the pipeline will be run for you by member of Platform Operations team*


### Check your email

Once pipeline runs successfully you should receive an email to your HMCTS email address with your encrypted password for non-live or live Azure Portal access.

If you are getting access to both tenants, you will receive two separate emails.
