Once your PR is created, the Platform Operations team will be notified and should review and approve your access request shortly.

### Slack Channel

Post in [#slack-channel-placeholder] with:
- Link to your PR
- Brief message: "Hi, I've submitted an access request PR - waiting for Platform Operations review"

The team monitors this channel and will prioritize your request.

### Code Owner Assignment

The GitHub code owners configuration should automatically assign the Platform Operations team. If this doesn't happen:

1. Check that your PR is linked properly in the repository
2. Mention `@platform-operations` in a comment on your PR
3. Reach out on Slack if still not assigned

## What Platform Operations Will Review

The team will verify:

- ✓ Public keys are in correct format and location
- ✓ Team assignment is valid
- ✓ All required information is present
- ✓ Manager approval (for live tenant access)

## Approval Process

Once approved, a Platform Operations team member will:

1. Approve the PR
2. Add a comment with next steps
3. Merge the PR into the repository

You'll receive a notification when this happens.

## Summary Checklist
