You should have received an email containing your encrypted password. In this step, you will decrypt it using your GPG key.

### Locate Your Email

Find the email from the Platform Operations automation containing your encrypted password.

Subject line will be similar to: **[Your New nonlive Account Details]** or **[Your New live Account Details]**

### Decrypt the Password

Encrypted password file will be attached to the email, click "Download" to save it locally.

Once you have file locally decrypt it using your private GPG key:

```bash
gpg --decrypt <your.name@hmctsnonlive.onmicrosoft.com-nonlive-enc-pwd.gpg
```

When prompted, enter your GPG passphrase.

The output will show your decrypted password.

### Important: Trailing Character

>⚠️ **Do not copy the trailing `%` character** that may appear at the end of the decrypted output.

Your actual password ends before this character.

#### Example

```
Decrypted output:  MySecurePassword123%
Actual password:   MySecurePassword123
```

Copy only: `MySecurePassword123`

### Save Your Password Securely

You will use this password in the next step when accessing Azure Portal.
