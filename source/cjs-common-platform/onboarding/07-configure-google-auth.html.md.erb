In previous step you retrieved and decrypted your Google Authenticator secret and OpenVPN profile.

In this step you will configure your authenticator app with the secret so you can generate the required codes for two-factor authentication.

### Option A: CLI utility (oathtool)

If you are using `iTerm2` then you can use built-in password manager to store your authenticator secret.

1. Press `option` + `command` + `F` (or click `Window > Password Manager`) to open password manager
2. Click `+` to add new password entry:
   - **Name:** OTP-non-live (or OTP-live)
   - **Username:** Your.Name
   - **Password:** Paste your authenticator secret here
3. Install `oathtool` if not already installed:

      ```bash
      brew install oath-toolkit
      ```

4. Paste following into your terminal to add handy alias to your `.zshrc`:

      ```bash
      echo '\nfunction oo() {
         echo -n "Enter the code:\\n"
         read -s code
         code=$(oathtool --base32 --totp $code)
         echo $code
         echo -n $code | pbcopy
      }\n' >> ~/.zshrc
      ```

5. Close and open terminal or run `exec zsh` to reload your shell
6. Run alias `oo`
7. When prompted press `option` + `command` + `F`, select `OTP-non-live` and press enter
8. Authenticator code will be generated and automatically copied to your clipboard

>⚠️ You will have two separate authenticator secrets for non-live and live if you have access to both environments.
So make sure to store each one as separate entries so you can easily retrieve the correct one.

6. Paste your Google Authenticator secret from the decrypted output into the `Your key` field
7. Tap `Add`
