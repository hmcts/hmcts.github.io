You should have received an email containing your encrypted password. In this step, you'll decrypt it using your GPG key.

## Locate Your Email

Find the email from the Platform Operations automation containing your encrypted password.

Subject line will be similar to: [Placeholder: example subject]

## Decrypt the Password

Copy the encrypted password from the email and save it to a file, then decrypt it:

```bash
# Save the encrypted content to a file (paste the email content)
cat > encrypted-password.txt << 'EOF'
[encrypted content from email]
EOF

# Decrypt using your GPG key
gpg --decrypt encrypted-password.txt
```

When prompted, enter your GPG passphrase.

The output will show your decrypted password.

## Important: Trailing Character

⚠️ **Do not copy the trailing `%` character** that may appear at the end of the decrypted output.

Your actual password ends before this character.

### Example

```
Decrypted output:  MySecurePassword123%

Actual password:   MySecurePassword123
```

Copy only: `MySecurePassword123`

## Save Your Password Securely

Once decrypted:

1. **Do not store in plain text** files in your home directory
2. **Do not commit to repositories**
3. **Consider using:** macOS Keychain, 1Password, or similar secure password manager

You'll use this password in the next step when accessing Azure Portal.
