In this step, you will configure your Crime non-live and/or live VPN connection.

### Prerequisites

Some of steps below will require admin permissions on your Mac which need to be requested by following [this document](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/spaces/DATS/pages/1824151238/1.+Temporary+Admin+Escalation+Process).

To avoid having to request admin session multiple times it is worth reading ahead through the entire VPN and DNS configuration steps so you can complete all tasks in a single admin session.

Before starting this step:

- Ensure your Crime account provisioning (described in [Step 3](03-get-approved.html)) has completed successfully
- Install Tunnelblick by [following instructions in this document](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/spaces/DATS/pages/1824151070/3.+TunnelBlick+Setup+for+NonAdmin+Macbook+Developers)
- Ensure you have your OpenVPN `.ovpn` secret file ready (see [Step 6](06-obtain-vpn-gauth-secrets.html) if you have not yet done this)

### Add VPN Configuration to Tunnelblick

Detailed Tunnelblick setup is described in the document linked above, but here is a summary:

1. Click on Tunnelblick icon in the top right menu bar
2. Select "VPN Details..."
3. Drag and drop your `.ovpn` file into the configurations list
4. Select **"Only Me"** when prompted
5. Click on your new connection and set: `Set DNS/WINS` to `Do not set nameserver`
6. Un-tick `Check if the apparent public IP address changed after connecting`
7. Go to `Preferences` and un-tick `Configuration changes: Require administrator authorization to install all configurations` **(⚠️ requires admin permissions)**
8. Click connect **(⚠️ requires admin permissions)**
9. After initial connection using this configuration, subsequent connections will not require admin permissions

>⚠️ If you have access to both non-live and live you will obtain two separate `.ovpn` files.
You will need to complete this import process for each one separately.
