Now that you have your key pairs, you will submit a pull request including those keys and your HMCTS email to get the access you need.

### Access the Setup Repository

[https://www.github.com/hmcts/cpp-terraform-azurerm-azuread](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-terraform-azurerm-azuread/blob/main/README.md)

You would have already pulled this repository in earlier step if you used the self-service scripts to generate your keys.

It contains the user access configuration and detailed guidance on the access request process.

### Prepare Your PR

Before creating your pull request, gather:

✓ Your GPG public key (from Step 1)

✓ Your SSH public key (from Step 1)

✓ Your team name (ask your colleagues which team you should join)

### Add your user to configuration

Configuration for each user is stored within:

- `vars/nonlive/*-users.tfvars` files for non-live tenant
- `vars/live/*-users.tfvars` files for live tenant

If you need access to both, add yourself to both a non-live and a live team file.

You do not need to generate new ssh/gpg keys for live access, the same keys are used for both nonlive and live access.

Here is an example of adding a new user to backend developers team in non-live tenant:

`vars/nonlive/backend_dev-users.tfvars`

```hcl
{
  user_principal_name = "<demo.user>@hmctsnonlive.onmicrosoft.com"
  display_name        = "Demo user"
  account_enabled     = true
  imported            = false
  initial_setup_info = {
    parent_email       = "demo.user@justice.gov.uk"
    ssh_b64_public_key = "<contents of your ssh-key.pub.b64 from Step 1>"
    gpg_b64_public_key = "<contents of your your-pub-key.asc.b64 from Step 1>"
  }
  job_title = "Your job title"
},
```

>⚠️ Make sure you have your manager approval before requesting access.

### Create the Pull Request

1. Create a new branch: 

```bash
git checkout -b onboarding/add-user-[your-name]
```

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Add user access: [your name]"

3. Push to remote:

4. Create the PR in GitHub with title: 

```bash
Add user access: [your name]
```
