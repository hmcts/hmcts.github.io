There are many different technology programmes within HMCTS. Typically different sections within HMCTS are divided up
and taken through a Reform programme. Once a Reform programme has been completed services are transitioned into [HMCTS
Digital and Technology Services](https://hmctsjobs.co.uk/roles/dts/) (DTS).

The gov.uk website has a [full list of Reform programmes](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-hmcts-reform-programme).

There are also a number of legacy services already within DTS that are maintained and operated by different teams.

Broadly these different areas are divided into CFT (Civil, Family and Tribunals), Crime, Legacy and SDS (Shared Digital
Services).
