The DTS Legacy Applications consist of a collection of 38 Web application services, DOM1-hosted applications and an infrastructure site.

They were originally developed and managed by different teams and consequently have been developed using different languages and frameworks.

The web application services are currently all hosted in various AWS accounts using various different AWS hosting methodologies.

The DOM1-hosted applications are a mixture of MS Access front-end applications, an excel spreadsheet and a VB6 application.

There is a separate team (DLRM) working on a roadmap for these applications with regards to their shelf-life and potential replacements.

The summary list of the services grouped by language and architecture can be found in the [Application Technology Overview](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RST/Application+Technology+Overview)
