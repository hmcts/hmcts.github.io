In order to improve the existing services from a support and maintenance perspective the Legacy team are undergoing a process of migrating the Web application services to two HMCTS managed AWS platforms:

- **AWS Cloud Platform** - This platform will host the services which can be migrated to run as Linux dockerised containers.

  The official documentation for this environment can be found [on confluence](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#cloud-platform-user-guide/)

- **AWS Modernisation Platform** - This platform will host the services which have been written using old versions of the Windows .Net platform and cannot be easily upgraded to .Net Core

  The official documentation for this environment can be found [on confluence](https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)

The aim is to provide a standardised hosting architecture, pipeline build and an upgraded set of application components (Java versions, database versions) where possible.

Both platform migrations require the creation of Terraform Infrastructure as Code scripts, which currently do not exist.
