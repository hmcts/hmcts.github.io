# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This path to live section shows some of the steps you may need to create when you create a new service.

- If you're going live on a frontend application you need to read all pages in this section.
<% current_page.children.each do |page| %>
  - [<%= page.data.title %>](<%= page.url %>)
<% end %>

- If you're going live on a backend application you only need to read the
[Load balancer configuration](load-balancer-configuration.html) page.
- If you are only creating a new infrastructure project, you do not need to follow this section. Instead follow the [Starting a new component](/ways-of-working/new-component/) guide.
- See [Operational Acceptance Testing](oat.html) for more details on the prerequisites to accept the application into production.



There may be other business processes you need to go through, but they are out of scope of this section.
