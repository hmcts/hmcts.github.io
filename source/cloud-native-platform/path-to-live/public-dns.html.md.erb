## External DNS

We use [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/dns/) for managing our public DNS.

The DNS is self-service, managed in the
[azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/tree/master/environments) repository,
follow the [shuttering](shutter.html#pre-requisite) instructions for which records you need to add
for a new service.

## Setup required for an application
- Copy the FrontDoor endpoint hostname for the environment:

<%= partial 'front-door-endpoints' %>

- Clone the [Azure Public DNS](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository.
- Under environments directory there are yaml files depicting environments that represents zones corresponding to each environment.
There can be multiple zones in one environment,
- Create afdverify CNAME records in the appropriate zone file for environments.
Here is an example [Pull Request](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/pull/1387/files),
- Create a PR with records as per the below convention
(make sure you replace the variables with the correct values).


```
- name: "afdverify.${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "afdverify.{copy endpoint hostname from frontdoor}"
- name: "${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "{copy endpoint hostname from frontdoor}"
```


## Verify custom domain on the Frontdoor
- Create TXT records in the appropriate zone file for environments.
Here is an example [Pull Request](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/pull/1409/files),
- Create a PR with records as per the below convention
(make sure you replace the variables with the correct values).


```
- name: "_dnsauth.${name}"
  ttl: 3600
  record: 
    - "{copy TXT record from frontdoor -> Domains -> and then click Pending in the validation state column}"
```

Where:

`${name}` =  Identifier that will be used to create endpoints and hosts entries in Frontdoor and CDN profiles.
This should be the `name` attribute from env.tfvars file e.g. [name attribute](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/fa598ca88221555abcbe54a52f0738ca20d48f59/environments/prod.tfvars#L17)

Send the PR for review to the [Platform Operations](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-code-review) team. Once the PR is merged terraform will create appropriate records.
