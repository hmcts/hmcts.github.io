## External DNS

We use [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/dns/) for managing our public DNS.

The DNS is self-service, managed in the
[azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/tree/master/environments) repository,
follow the [shuttering](shutter.html) instructions for which records you need to add
for a new service.

## Setup required for an application
- Copy the FrontDoor endpoint hostname for the environment:

<%= partial 'front-door-endpoints' %>

- Clone the [Azure Public DNS](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository.
- Under environments directory there are yaml files depicting environments that represents zones corresponding to each environment.
There can be multiple zones in one environment,
- Create a PR with records as per the below convention
(make sure you replace the variables with the correct values).


```
- name: "${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "{copy endpoint hostname from frontdoor}"
```

Where:

`${name}` =  Identifier that will be used to create endpoints and hosts entries in Frontdoor and CDN profiles.
This should be the `name` attribute from env.tfvars file e.g. [name attribute](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/fa598ca88221555abcbe54a52f0738ca20d48f59/environments/prod.tfvars#L17)

Send the PR for review to the [Platform Operations](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-code-review) team. Once the PR is merged terraform will create appropriate records.


### Synchronising Public DNS Zone CNAME Records with Private DNS Zone

We synchronize CNAME records from our public DNS zone to the corresponding private DNS zone, such as `sandbox.platform.hmcts.net`. This ensures that internal services can reach the correct destinations without encountering failures.

If you prefer not to sync specific public CNAME records to the private DNS zone, you can easily achieve this by setting `syncPrivateDNS` to `false`. By default, this setting is `true`, simplifying the synchronisation process when needed. Please note that the pipeline responsible for syncing records is scheduled to run overnight.

If you like to set different record for private dns zone, you can always update the  [azure-private-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-private-dns) repo, the sync pipeline will neither overwrite nor delete any records on private dns zones.

[Refer to this example](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/blob/0295fff5f4e498b9f2acf564e9f656cf4f1dbb34/environments/sandbox.yml#L259) for guidance on excluding records from synchronisation.
