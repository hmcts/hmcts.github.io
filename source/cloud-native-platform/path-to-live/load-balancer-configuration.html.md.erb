In all our path-to-live environments we run two clusters for high availability
and zero down-time upgrades. We load balance across these clusters using an
[Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) which has a health probe for each application
deployed to an environment.

For backend applications a couple of lines of config need to be added:

- CFT Platform: [load balancer config](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/master/environments/prod/backend_lb_config.yaml)
- SDS Platform: [load balancer config](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-azure-platform/blob/master/environments/prod/backend_lb_config.yaml)

Frontend applications are automatically handled as part of the
[front door config](front-door.html),
that config provides all the information we need for setting up the load balancer,
so frontend applications skip the above step.
