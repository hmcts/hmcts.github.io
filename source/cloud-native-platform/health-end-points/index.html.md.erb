## Readiness Checks on Kubernetes

Readiness probes are crucial in Kubernetes as they are called periodically, impacting container availability. 
Failing readiness checks make containers temporarily unavailable, preventing incoming requests from reaching your application. It's essential to consider what checks to include in readiness probes to avoid unnecessary downtime.

### Considerations:

- Include exclusive/hard dependencies for your service in readiness checks.
- Avoid including soft dependencies; handle their unavailability in code for a better customer experience.

**Good Example:**
- A private cache/database (e.g., Redis or Postgres) exclusive to the application.

**Bad Example:**
- Shared components like IDAM, S2S, or CCD.

## Add Database Check to Liveness Probe

The "Liveness" state of an application indicates whether its internal state allows it to work correctly or recover by itself if failing. A broken "Liveness" state suggests the application cannot recover, prompting infrastructure to restart the application.

Ensure the ongoing health of your application by incorporating a dedicated health check within the liveness probe, focusing on monitoring database indicators. Guidance on implementation can be found in this [example](https://github.com/hmcts/spring-boot-template/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.yaml).
