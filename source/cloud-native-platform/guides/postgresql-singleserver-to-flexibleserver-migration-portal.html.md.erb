# <%= current_page.data.title %>

The Azure Portal can be used to perform an offline migration of a PostgreSQL Single Server instance to PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

This simple method has lower chances of failure and no restrictions in terms of database objects it can handle.

### Limitations

- Will result in downtime for applications.

### Prerequisite 

- Create target Postgresql flexible server using [terraform module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-postgresql-flexible). Make sure database names and sizes are identical and equal or larger in size respectively.
- Enable `extensions` on flexible server. List of extensions should be identical to single server. 

```yaml
# run SQL query on single server to get list of extensions. 
select * from pg_extension;
```

```yaml
# Update/Add this `terraform variable` with the list of required extensions.
pgsql_server_configuration = [
    {
      name  = azure.extensions
      value = <name of extension eg. plpgsql>
    },
    {
      name  = azure.extensions
      value = <name of extension eg. pg_stat_statements>
    }
]
```

#### Set allow access to azure services to "Yes" on Postgresql single server

Within Azure Portal:
- Select the PostgreSQL single server
- Under Settings -> connection security
- Ensure "Allow access to Azure Services" is set to `Yes`

If not, you may notice error similar to the below during the migration attempt:
```bash
S0002: Connecting to the Source DB server failed. ErrorMessage: Validation of one or more databases failed.Failed to run `select 1;` with exception 28000: SSL connection is required. Please specify SSL options and retry.. Parameter name: SourceDBServerResourceId
```

### Migration Steps

AzureDevops pipeline has been created to facilitate migration process. Follow instructions in README.MD file located in [repo](https://github.com/hmcts/flexible-server-migration).
