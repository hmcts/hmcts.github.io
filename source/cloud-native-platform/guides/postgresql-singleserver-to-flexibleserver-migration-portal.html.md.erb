The Azure Portal can be used to perform an offline migration of a PostgreSQL Single Server instance to PostgreSQL Flexible Server.

This simple method has lower chances of failure and no restrictions in terms of database objects it can handle.

### Limitations

- Will result in downtime for applications.
- Cannot be used to migrate databases from single servers using General Purpose SKU to flexible servers using Burstable SKU.

### Prerequisite 

- Create target Postgresql flexible server using terraform module. Make sure database names and sizes are identical and equal or larger in size respectively.
- Allowlist all required extensions as shown in [Migrate from Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server to Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/migrate/concepts-single-to-flexible#allow-list-required-extensions). It is important to allowlist the extensions before you initiate a migration using this tool.

### Migration Steps

Follow Azure [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/migrate/how-to-migrate-single-to-flexible-portal#configure-the-migration-task).

Developers need to reach out to platform operation team for database password.
