Subscriptions are managed via a GitHub repository [hmcts/azure-enterprise](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-enterprise).

The [README](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-enterprise/blob/main/README.md) in the repository contains full details on the procedure that must be followed to add a new subscription to the Azure AD tenant.
