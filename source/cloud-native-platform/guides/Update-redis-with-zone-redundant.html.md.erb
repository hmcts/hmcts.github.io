# Update Redis with Zone Redundancy

This guide explains how to update your Azure Cache for Redis to enable zone redundancy for improved availability and resilience.


## For Existing Premium Tier Redis Caches

> **Main advice:** Please perform these changes out of hours, as there is a possibility of downtime.

If you already have a Premium tier Redis cache instance:

1. **Go to Access Package and request Redis Cache Contributor Access (Production)**. Once activated, proceed to the next step.
2. Go to the Azure Portal
   - Navigate to your Redis cache
   - Go to Settings â†’ Advanced settings in the left navigation menu
   - Check the "Zone redundancy" option
   - Click Save

### Update Terraform Configuration

After zone redundancy has been enabled in the portal, the development team should update their Terraform configuration:

```hcl
sku_name = "Premium"
family   = "P"
rdb_backup_enabled = true
```

When you run `terraform plan`, it will show it needs to create a Storage Account but won't recreate the Redis instance.
Running `terraform apply` will create the Storage Account needed for backup functionality.

> **Note:** The Storage Account is required for the RDB backup feature enabled with `rdb_backup_enabled = true` in your Terraform configuration.

## Important Environment and Cost Considerations

> **Note:** Zone redundancy should only be enabled for production environments to avoid higher costs in lower environments. This process is intended only for the following production subscriptions:
>
> - DCD-CNP-Prod
> - DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-PROD

Please ensure you are applying these changes only in the specified production subscriptions.
