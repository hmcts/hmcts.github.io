Feature flags are a powerful tool that can enhance a team's productivity; but they should be used sparingly, as described below.  For further information and background regarding these guidelines, [click here](background-information.html).

## When to use feature flags

| Use case | Guidelines |
|----------|-------------|
| **Dark deployments** | If you absolutely *must*.

## Feature-flag platforms


| Platform | Guidelines |
|----------|-------------|
| **LaunchDarkly** | The incumbent choice.
| **Azure App Configuration** | The strategic choice.
| **Environment variables** | The simplest choice.


End to end Process:

1. Developer creates and commits short lived feature branch with Feature flag off.
2. Implements feature through iterations of small feature lifecycle.
3. Code is continuously released.
4. Retire feature toggle.


### Accessing LaunchDarkly

Developers automatically get access by being part of 'DTS CFT Developers' or 'DTS SDS Developers', non-developers can get access with the 'DTS LaunchDarkly' group.
see [onboarding](../onboarding/person/index.html) process to request access. You will need to login from [myapps.microsoft.com](https://myapps.microsoft.com/hmcts.net).

After you've logged in once you will be able to login from [app.launchdarkly.com](https://app.launchdarkly.com/).

### Documentation

Documentation can be accessed directly from the [LaunchDarkly](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home) website.
Their [blog](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/) contains good information.

### Creating a new project

See [hmcts/launchdarkly-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/launchdarkly-terraform) for instructions on how to setup your new project.

### Environments

We currently provide 'Test' and 'Production' environments by default within Launch Darkly. Flags are generally set to the same value in both 'Production' and the 'Test' environment, [flag targeting](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/guides/tutorials/rules-and-targeting) is used to control rollout of flags to users across environments.

If your team does require additional environments, you can do this by updating your teams [terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/hmcts/launchdarkly-terraform/blob/896019ed1efdebdf9237b7811ab2b9585a7708f2/terraform.tfvars#L59-L61). 
It is not recommended to do this as targeting rules should be simpler to manage and ensure consistency across environments.
