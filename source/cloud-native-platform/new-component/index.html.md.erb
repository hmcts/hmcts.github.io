When you create a new component (such as a database, application or a combination of such resources), you will need to follow some or all of the following:

- Understand our [infrastructure as code](infrastructure-as-code.html) approach
- Understand the [common pipeline](../common-pipeline/)
- [Create new Github repo](github-repo.html)
- Use our standard approach to [secrets management](secrets-management.html)
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring
- Database schema management

If you are creating an application you will need:

- [Helm](helm-chart.html) for package management
- [Flux](gitops-flux.html#application-config-in-flux) to automatically deploy pushed and merged code

If you are creating a new frontend or backend service, you should read [Path-to-live](../path-to-live/)
