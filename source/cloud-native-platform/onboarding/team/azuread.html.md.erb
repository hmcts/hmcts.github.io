Microsoft Entra ID is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions in Azure. When your github user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.

## Access to an existing team

Follow the instructions on the [person onboarding guide](/cloud-native-platform/onboarding/person/#microsoft-entra-id-groups).

## Creating a new team

If you are a new team or just need a group created, then do a pull request to the [azure-access](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access/blob/master/users/groups.yml) repository and get it approved by Platform Operations.

It should look like:

```yaml
groups:
- name: DTS Your Team name
```
