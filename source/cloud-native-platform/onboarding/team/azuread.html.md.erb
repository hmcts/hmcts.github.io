Microsoft Entra ID is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions in Azure. When your github user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.


## Access to a an existing team.

Follow the instructions on the [person onboarding guide](/cloud-native-platform/onboarding/person/#microsoft-entra-id-groups).

## Creating a new team

If you are a new team or just need a group created, then do a pull request to the [devops-azure-ad](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad/blob/master/users/groups.yml) repository and get it approved by Platform Operations.

It should look like:


```yaml
groups:
- name: DTS Your Team name
```
