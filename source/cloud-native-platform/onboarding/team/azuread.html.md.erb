Azure AD is used to give you and your team-mates access to specific subscriptions in Azure. When your github user has access to a subscription, you will be able to view, create and modify Azure resources for your team.


## Access to a an existing team.

Follow the instructions on the [person onboarding guide](/cloud-native-platform/onboarding/person/#azure-ad-groups).

## Creating a new team

If you are unsure which groups you need to be a part of, ask your team or create a help request in the [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/messages/platops-help) channel on Slack. For example:

> Hi
> I am part of a new team "[Team name]"

> Can you please create a team AAD group: "DTS [Team name]"
