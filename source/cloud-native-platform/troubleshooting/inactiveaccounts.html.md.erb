## Receiving an email regarding inactive account

You may have received an email from our scheduled pipeline which deletes guest user accounts if they're inactive for longer than 31 days.

### Account close to being deleted

Users who are within a week of being deleted get notified via email on the lead up to the deletion date, starting 7 days before.

If you have received an email about your account being close to being deleted, because of inactivity, that is because you haven't logged into the `CJS Common Platform` Azure Tenant for a while and need to do so now to keep your access.

Please don't ignore this email if you use the `CJS Common Platform` Tenant or GitHub as you will lose access to both if you don't log in.

To extend your access, visit the [CJS Common Platform Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/531ff96d-0ae9-462a-8d2d-bec7c0b42082).

*Note:* We're looking into fixing this soon so that as long as you're active in either GitHub or the `CJS Common Platform` Tenant you will not lose access.

### Account has been deleted

If your account has been deleted and you need it re-enabled, you need to create a ticket via slack in the [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help) channel and someone will send you another guest invite.

Once that is done you will then be able to get your GitHub access back by asking one of your team members to create a PR in the [github-management](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management) repository, adding your user back in.

[Example PR - adding a user](https://github.com/hmcts/github-management/pull/1079/files) (requires access to the HMCTS GitHub organisation)
