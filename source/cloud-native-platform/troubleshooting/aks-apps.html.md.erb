- There could be many reasons why applications could fail to startup like :
  - A secret referred in helm chart is missing in keyvaults
  - Pod identity is not able to pull keyvault secrets due to missing permissions
  - There is not enough space in the cluster to fit in a new pod.
  - Pod is scheduled, but fails to pass readiness (`/health/readiness`) or  liveness (`/health/liveness`) checks.
  - A misconfigured environment variable, example - incorrect URL of a dependent service.

- Below are some handy kubectl commands to debug the issues

  To check latest events on your namespace:

   ```shell
   kubectl get events -n <your-namespace>
   ```

   To check status of pods:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace> | grep <helm-release-name>

   #Examples
   # kubectl get pods -n ccd | grep ccd-data-store-api
   # kubectl get pods -n ccd | grep pr-123
   ```

   To check status of a specific pod which is not running

   ```shell
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <your-namespace>
   ```

   To check logs of pods which is not starting

   ```shell
   kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <your-namespace>

   #To follow logs
   kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <your-namespace> -f

   # To check previous pod logs if its restarting
   kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <your-namespace> -p

   ```
