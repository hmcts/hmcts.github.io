### How to start and stop the resources for an environment from pipeline

Currently we start and stop the AKS Clusters, Application Gateways and Postgres Flexible Servers for the abovementioned environments. If required, the resources in an environment can be started outside of these hours using a GitHub action on the [auto-shutdown](https://github.com/hmcts/auto-shutdown) repository.

#### Start or Stop a specific environment

This manual job will start or stop the below resources for a specific environment:
- AKS Cluster
- Application Gateway
- Postgres Flexible Server
- Virtual Machines (this includes jumpboxes and bastions)

1. Navigate to [Manual Start / Stop](https://github.com/hmcts/auto-shutdown/actions/workflows/manual-start-stop.yaml) action on the auto-shutdown repository.
2. Select 'Run Workflow'
3. Ensure the 'master' branch and the correct Mode, Business Area and Environment options are selected. Then select 'Run Workflow'
4. Select the new build which will appear at the top under Workflow Runs and will be identifiable by an orange dot which means the build is currently running.

### Skip shutdown functionality
In the event that an environment or environments are needed outside of the default hours, you can raise a request to automatically exclude it from the shutdown schedule.
You can view more details in the auto-shutdown [README](https://github.com/hmcts/auto-shutdown/blob/master/README.md)

### How to ask for help
If you need help you can raise a help request to the Platform Operations team via the [#platops-help](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-help) channel.
