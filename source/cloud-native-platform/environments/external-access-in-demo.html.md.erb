The demo environment is used to demonstrate new features to external stakeholders.

For guidance on how to deploy an application to the demo environment, see [Application config in flux](../new-component/gitops-flux.html#application-config-in-flux).

There are three different ways in which an application in demo can be made available to external users. This is dependent on the ingress class used in your application.

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) is used as the ingress controller in HMCTS applications.

The following traefik instances are available to use:

| IngressClass | Default | Application configuration |
|-|-|-|
| traefik | Yes | Application will be reachable externally without VPN. End user will be required to authenticate to Azure AD before being redirected to the application |
| traefik-private | No | Application will be available over VPN only |
| traefik-no-proxy | No | Application will be reachable externally without VPN or authentication |

### Protecting applications with Azure AD authentication

To ensure end users must authenticate to Azure AD before they can view the application in their web browser, you must also set the `enableOAuth` flag to `true`

```yaml
nodejs:
  ingressClass: traefik
  disableTraefikTls: false
  enableOAuth: true
```

#### Getting access to HMCTS Demo Azure AD tenant

If you are not currently a member of the HMCTS Demo Azure AD tenant, check with your team to see if anyone else is. Everyone in this tenant has permission to invite others.

If no-one in your team is currently a member of the tenant, please raise a request via the [`#platops-help`](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/archives/C8SR5CAMU) channel in Slack.

To invite a new guest user, navigate to [Azure AD](https://portal.azure.com/hmctsexecdemo.onmicrosoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/MsGraphUsers) and click `New guest user`.

Enter the users name and email address and click `Invite`.

### Protecting applications with HMCTS VPN

If you want your application to only be available on VPN, you must specify the `traefik-private` ingressClass.

You do not need to specify the `enableOAuth` flag in this case.

```yaml
nodejs:
    ingressClass: traefik-private
    disableTraefikTls: false
```

### Making applications externally reachable without VPN or authentication

<%= warning_text('This should only be done for applications that do not work with Azure AD authentication or VPN. Ask Platform Operations first if you are unsure')%>

If you want your application to only be available without VPN and Azure AD authentication, you must specify the `traefik-no-proxy` ingressClass.

You do not need to specify the `enableOAuth` flag in this case.

```yaml
nodejs:
  ingressClass: traefik-no-proxy
  disableTraefikTls: false
```
