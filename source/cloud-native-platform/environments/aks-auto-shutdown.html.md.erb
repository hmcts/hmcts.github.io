### How to start and stop the cluster from pipeline

If required, an AKS cluster can be started or stopped using a GitHub action on the [aks-auto-shutdown](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-auto-shutdown/) repository.

#### Start a specific cluster/environment
1. Navigate to [AKS Manual Start](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-auto-shutdown/actions/workflows/aks-manual-start.yaml) action on the aks-auto-shutdown repository.
2. Select 'Run Workflow'
3. Ensure the 'master' branch and the correct Business Area, Environment and Cluster option are selected. Then select 'Run Workflow'
4. Select the new build which will appear at the top under Workflow Runs and will be identifiable by an orange dot which means the build is currently running.
5. Select 'build' under 'Jobs'
6. Expand the 'AKS Auto Start' dropdown to view the job output.

#### Shutdown a specific cluster/environment
1. Navigate to [AKS Manual Shutdown](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-auto-shutdown/actions/workflows/aks-manual-shutdown.yaml) action on the aks-auto-shutdown repository.
2. Select 'Run Workflow'
3. Ensure the 'master' branch and the correct Business Area, Environment and Cluster option are selected. Then select 'Run Workflow'
4. Select the new build which will appear at the top under Workflow Runs and will be identifiable by an orange dot which means the build is currently running.

### How to update tags in portal

1. Navigate to 'Kubernetes services' on the Azure Portal.
2. Select the relevant cluster from the list.
3. Select the 'edit' button beside tags.
4. If auto-shutdown of the specific AKS cluster is enabled, there will be a tag with the name 'autoShutdown' and its value will be 'true'. To disable auto-shutdown for this cluster change this value to false.
