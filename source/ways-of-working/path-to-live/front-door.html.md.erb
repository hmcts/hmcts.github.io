## Purpose

## Configuration

We use [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/frontdoor/) as our entry point
into the HMCTS estate.

Configuration is managed in the frontends section of 
[azure-platform-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/master/environments/prod/prod.tfvars).

Before sending a pull request to this repo ensure that:

- your DNS pull request has been merged,
- your TLS certificate has been stored in vault, if you aren't sure then just create the pull request,
the build will fail if it isn't present.

Once the above is complete, send a pull request with your configuration change,
you can ask for review in [#platops-code-review](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-code-review).
