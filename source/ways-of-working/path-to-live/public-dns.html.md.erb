## External DNS

We use [Azure DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/dns/) for managing our public DNS.

The DNS is self-service, managed in the 
[azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/tree/master/environments) repository, 
follow the [shuttering](shutter.html#pre-requisite) instructions for which records you need to add
for a new service.

## Setup required for an application

- Clone the [Azure Public DNS](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository.
- Under environments directory there are yaml files depicting environments that represents zones corresponding to each environment. 
There can be multiple zones in one environment,
- Create afdverify and cdnverify CNAME records in the appropriate zone file for environments. 
Here is an example [Pull Request](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/pull/43/files),
- Create a PR with records as per the below convention 
(make sure you replace the variables with the correct values).

```
- name: "afdverify.${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "afdverify.hmcts-${env}.azurefd.net"
- name: "cdnverify.${name}" #Â only needed on prod as we don't shutter non production apps
  ttl: 300
  record: "cdnverify.hmcts-${name}-shutter-${env}.azureedge.net"
- name: "${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "hmcts-${env}.azurefd.net"
```

Where:

`${env}`  =  Name of the environment for which you are creating the recordsets. Valid values are `sbox` or `prod`. 

`${name}` =  Identifier that will be used to create endpoints and hosts entries in Frontdoor and CDN profiles.
This should be the `name` attribute from env.tfvars file e.g. [name attribute](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/fa598ca88221555abcbe54a52f0738ca20d48f59/environments/prod.tfvars#L17)

Send the PR for review to the [Platform Operations](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=platops-code-review) team. Once the PR is merged terraform will create appropriate records.
