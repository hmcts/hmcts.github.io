## Purpose

This section should give you all the information you need to technically get an application live,
there may be other business processes you need to go through but they are out of scope of this
section.

If you're going live on a backend application you only need to read the 
[Load balancer configuration](load-balancer-configuration.html) page.

If you're going live on a frontend application you need to read all pages in this section.
