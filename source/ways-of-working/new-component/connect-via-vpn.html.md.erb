This page discribes how to set up the ability to tunnel into a Virtual Machine with no Public IP Address via the HMCTS VPN.

> Note: Your project will need to be managed by Terraform to set this up.

To do this you will need to setup network peering between the VPN and your application managed Vnet.

This is an example of the Terraform used to [setup peering between two Vnets](https://github.com/hmcts/sharedservices-aks-infrastructure/blob/master/terraform/modules/tfm-azure-network-peering/10-network-peering.tf).

The destination Vnet details are:

```` 
vnet name: core-infra-vnet-mgmt
vnet id: /subscriptions/ed302caf-ec27-4c64-a05e-85731c3ce90e/resourceGroups/rg-mgmt/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/core-infra-vnet-mgmt
vnet resource group: rg-mgmt
vnet subscription: Reform-CFT-Mgmt
```` 

Once this is setup and deployed, you can then make a request to PlatOps in \#platops-help to add the Address Space for your Vnet or Virtual Machine with what ports to whitelist, e.g.
