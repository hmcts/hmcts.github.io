Any developer added to [hmcts org](https://github.com/hmcts) is able to create a new Github repo.


1. Naming convention for repository is `{product}-{component}`.
2. Choose from a template in the drop down depending on whether it's a front end or backend component. These templates provide all the boiler plate code needed for a new app. 
    - [spring-boot-template](https://github.com/hmcts/spring-boot-template)
    - [expressjs-template](https://github.com/hmcts/expressjs-template)
3. Repository should be public. [Gov UK guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)
4. Do not add any collaborators outside organization. All access needs to be managed with GitHub teams and not users.
    
    _Note: You need to remove the user level admin access you got while creating the repository after you have added your team admins with the admin role._
    
5. Give permissions to GitHub teams created in [Team Onboarding](/onboarding/team/#github-config)
    <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Github Team</th>
       <th>Role</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>`<team-name>`</td>
       <td>write</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>`<team-name>-admins`</td>
       <td>admin</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
    
6. Add a branch protection rule for `master` branch with recommended settings
   - Enable `Require pull request reviews before merging`
   - Choose which status checks needs to be mandatory for merging PRs (this can be done only after checks like Jenkins are setup)
   - We recommend enabling `Include administrators`.
