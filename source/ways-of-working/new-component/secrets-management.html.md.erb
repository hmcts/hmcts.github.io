We use [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) for managing secrets.

- Use [cnp-module-key-vault](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-module-key-vault) terraform module to create key vaults.
- Naming convention for keyvaults is `{product}-{component}-{env}`. 

    <%= warning_text('Name of the keyvault cannot exceed 24 characters, which means {product}-{component} length cannot be more than 15 characters') %>

- Your team will [manage the secrets](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-module-key-vault#writing-secrets-to-key-vaults), use the CLI to write secrets as you won't be able to see the vault in production, only write and list access is given out, if you're unsure if a credential is correct you can just overwrite it with the correct one.
- Use shared vaults (`{product}-{env}`) created through shared infrastructure repository if there are more secrets shared across multiple components in your product. 
- If any secrets are exposed in the open, raise a security incident, by reporting it to 'Security Operations', create a new secret, update the application configuration and revoke the old secret. 

## Setup application access.

1. Applications running in Kubernetes use [managed identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity) to access secrets from keyvaults.
2. We recommend using one manage identity per product / team. 
3. Managed Identity can be created by using the [cnp-module-keyvault](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-module-key-vault#managed_identity_object_ids) terraform module.
    `Note: You need to run your infrastructure pipeline on each environment for this to be added`
4. Add `AzureIdentity` k8s resources to [Flux](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/blob/master/bin/base-ns-id-gen.sh).
5. All base helm charts support [configuring keyvaults](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-java#adding-azure-key-vault-secrets) to mount secrets on container file system using [kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-keyvault-flexvol). 
6. Applications should use [properties-volume-nodejs](https://github.com/hmcts/properties-volume-nodejs) or [properties-volume-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/hmcts/properties-volume-spring-boot-starter) to set secrets from file systems as environment variables.
