Feature flags are a software development and delivery technique that allows software teams to enable and disable parts of a codebase at the flip of a switch.
Feature flags enable software teams to adopt DevOps practices, in so much as they help increase deployment speeds, system stability, and cross-team collaboration.
Feature flags also allow you to decouple code deployments from feature releases. You can make code changes in production while hiding those changes from users.
