[Helm](https://helm.sh) is the package manager for Kubernetes.

We deploy all of our applications using a helm chart to Kubernetes.

## Installing helm

Install helm along with the other tools using the links on the 
[person onboarding doc](/onboarding/person/#the-following-tools-are-commonly-used).

## Base charts

We provide opinionated, batteries included helm charts that give:

1. a simple interface to provide application configuration,
2. features that a wide variety of applications require,
3. a standard approach for all applications,
4. in built support for secrets from Azure KeyVault,

You shouldn't need to understand helm to use our charts,
for a simple app this is all the configuration you need:

```yaml
java:
  applicationPort: 4550
  image: 'hmctspublic.azurecr.io/rpe/spring-boot-template:latest'
  environment:
    A_KEY: 'a value'
```

To see the full helm chart take a look at 
[spring-boot-template](https://github.com/hmcts/spring-boot-template/tree/master/charts/rpe-spring-boot-template).

The main base charts are:

- [chart-base](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-base)
- [chart-java](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-java)
- [chart-nodejs](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-nodejs)
- [chart-job](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-job)

## What are values.*.template.yaml for?

We deploy the microservice helm charts for testing using Jenkins only on preview and AAT,

Jenkins will override the configuration of the helm chart using these files.

- `values.preview.template.yaml` is for preview
- `values.aat.template.yaml` is for AAT

It is expected that `values.yaml` will provide a working chart out of the box that someone can install on their own machine,

The `values.aat.template.yaml` file should only include the absolute minimum config:

```yaml
java:
  environment:
  # Don't modify below here
  image: ${IMAGE_NAME}
  ingressHost: ${SERVICE_FQDN}
```

The `values.preview.template.yaml` may contain additional config if other services are being
spun up on pull requests,

Some common examples:

- a postgresql database - this is included in [chart-java](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-java#postgresql) , with sensible defaults built in,
- a Redis cache,
- [chart-idam-pr](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-idam-pr) - a job that registers your `redirect_uri` in IDAM,
- [chart-blobstorage](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-blobstorage) - creates Azure Blob storage for you, using [OSBA](https://osba.sh/),
- [chart-servicebus](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-servicebus) - creates Azure Service Bus for you, using [OSBA](https://osba.sh/).


If you are using another sub-chart just for preview such as an embedded redis container,
then you should make this conditional with:

Chart.yaml:

```yaml 
dependencies:
  - name: redis
    version: 10.6.18
    repository: "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"
    condition: redis.enabled
```

values.yaml:

```yaml
redis:
  enabled: false
```

values.preview.template.yaml:

```yaml
redis:
    enabled: true
    master:
      persistence:
        enabled: false
```


## Publishing helm charts

We publish charts in two different ways depending on the type of chart.

Microservice charts are published via Jenkins as they live with the code and changes
to them are tested via the standard pipeline that everyone uses.

Base charts and non application charts are published via Azure DevOps.

### Jenkins

Jenkins will deploy your application using your helm chart in the application's repository
on every master and pull request build.

On a master build after functional testing has passed the chart will be published
if it has not already been published.

To publish a new version:

- Bump the version field in Chart.yaml in a pull request
- After approval and a passing build merge it to master

You should always publish a new version if you change values.yaml or requirements.yaml,
Jenkins will automatically increase the version if you don't do this, so you don't need to worry too much.

### Azure DevOps

Chart builds are run against the 'preview' AKS cluster, 
and chart are published to 'hmctspublic' Azure Container Registry.

See the [chart-java pipeline](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-java/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yaml) for an example.

It does:

- on pull request: trigger a build that performs helm lint, helm install and helm test
- on tag: trigger a build that performs helm lint, helm install, helm test, helm package and 
publish to 'hmctspublic' ACR

There are [reusable jobs](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-azuredevops-libraries/tree/master/jobs/charts) that you can use.

#### Performing a Release

Performing a release consists of the following steps:

1. Submit your PR which also includes a chart version bump (the version field in Chart.yaml)
2. Wait for the PR validation build to pass and a colleague's approval
3. Merge the PR
4. Create a Github release, tagging it with the same version number used in Chart.yaml
5. The release build will be triggered, publishing the new chart version

#### Setting up an AzureDevOps chart build

Join the `dcd_group_ado_user_v2` AzureAD group, this will give you:

1. Access to AzureDevOps,
2. Read access to the CNP project where the chart builds live.

Add an azure-pipelines.yml file to your repo, using 
[chart-java](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-java/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yaml) as a base.

Ask on [#rpe](https://hmcts-reform.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=rpe) on slack for someone to setup the pipeline for you in AzureDevOps.

## All charts

We follow a standard naming convention of `chart-<name>` for all Helm charts, you can find a list of all
charts using [GitHub search](https://github.com/hmcts/?utf8=%25E2%259C%2593&q=chart-&type=&language=).
