Feature flags are a software development and delivery technique that allows software teams to enable and disable parts of a codebase at the flip of a switch.
Feature flags enable a team to deliver new features to use rapidly but safely.
Feature flags also allow you to decouple code deployments from feature releases. You can make code changes in production while hiding those changes from users.

### Trunk Based Development
Trunk Based Development is a branching model in which developers create short-lived feature branches and merge back into the “trunk” branch, often called as the master/main branch.
It reduces the complexity of merging events and keeps code current by having fewer development lines and by doing small and frequent merges.
Trunk based Development and Feature Flags together can be used for continuous delivery, delivering the features faster to market.
Trunk Based Development uses Feature Flags as a mechanism to manage new feature releases. Feature flags allow developers to deploy incomplete features to production without releasing them to end-users.

End to end Process:

    - 1) Developers creates and commit short lived feature branch with Feature flag off.
    - 2) Impelements features through may iterations of small feature lifecycle.
    - 3) Code is continuously released.
    - 4) Retire feature toggle.


### Accessing LaunchDarkly

    - Developers automatically get access by being part of 'DTS CFT Developers' or 'DTS SDS Developers', non developers can get access with the 'DTS LaunchDarkly' group.
      see [onboarding](../../onboarding/person/index.html) process to request access.
    - [URL](https://app.launchdarkly.com/)

### Documentation

    - Documentation can be accessed directly from the [LaunchDarkly](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home) website.
    - [Blog](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/) contain rich source of information.

### Creating a new project

    See [hmcts/launchdarkly-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/launchdarkly-terraform) for instructions on how to setup your new project.

### Environments

    We currently provide 'Test' and 'Production' environments only within Launch Darkly. Flags are generally set the same value in both 'Production' and the 'Test' environment, flag targeting is used to control rollout of flags to users across environments.
