## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the shutter solution design and its end to end implementation.

## Solution

![Shutter Solution Design Docs](/images/Shuttersolution_v2.png)

## Default shutter page
By default the following shutter page is used as per the Gov.uk patterns [service-unavailable-pages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/service-unavailable-pages/)


## Implementation and Customization
Creating and Enabling the shutter solution for an application is a 3 step process as outlined below:

- Create CDN infrastructure
- Upload static content to Azure storage account
- Enable shutter with a DNS swap

## Pre-requisite
Before creating the the CDN profiles, custom domains needs to registered with Azure public DNS. 
For more details about custom domains click [Azure CDN custom Domain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-map-content-to-custom-domain#map-the-temporary-cdnverify-subdomain)

Following steps ensures DNS entries:

- Clone the [Azure Public DNS](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository.
- Under environments directory there are yaml files depicting environments that represents zones corresponding to each environment. There can be multiple zones in one environment.
- Create afdverify and cdnverify CNAME records in the appropriate zone file for environments. Check [Pull Request](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/pull/43/files)
- Create a PR with records as per the below convention

```
- name: "afdverify.${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "afdverify.hmcts-${env}.azurefd.net"
- name: "cdnverify.${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "cdnverify.hmcts-${name}-shutter-${env}.azureedge.net"
- name: "${name}"
  ttl: 300
  record: "hmcts-${env}.azurefd.net"
```

Where:

`${env}`  =  Name of the environment for which you are creating the recordsets. Valid values are `sbox` or `prod`. 

`${name}` =  Identifier that will be used to create endpoints and hosts entries in Frontdoor and CDN profiles.
This should be the `name` attribute from env.tfvars file e.g. [name attribute](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/fa598ca88221555abcbe54a52f0738ca20d48f59/environments/prod.tfvars#L17)

Send the PR for review to Platform-Engineering/Devops team. Once the PR is merged terraform will create appropriate records.

### CDN infrastructure
CDN infrastructure comprise of the following Azure resources:

- Azure storage account
- Azure CDN profile

[shutter_page terraform module] (https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/tree/master/modules/shutter_page) is used to create the required resources in Azure. 

CDN infrastructure is automatically created by enabling frontend configuration with respective env.tfvars file e.g. [Frontend config](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/pull/91/files)

Above config creates the following resources:

 - Azure storage account using `name` attribute for each of the frontends
 - Enable azure static website with `$web` blob conatiner
 - Common Azure CDN profile for the environment e.g. `hmcts-shutter-prod`
 - Azure CDN endpoint for each of the frontend with the origin as the primary endpoint of the corresponding azure storage account
 - Enable custom domain for the static website
 - Enable https on the custom domain using certificates in the Azure Keyvault

### Uploading static shutter pages to Azure storage account
Once the shutter infrastructure is created, static content needs to be uploaded to the storage account.
Following repository is used [azure-shutter-pages](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-shutter-pages)

There is a default shutter page available to be used. 

In order to use the [default](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-shutter-pages/tree/master/default) shutter page follow the below steps:

- Create a PR with the following changes in the [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-shutter-pages/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) file.

```
${shuttername}:
  name: '${shuttername}'
  shutter: 'default'
```

where:

`${shuttername}` is the `name` attribute from env.tfvars file without the `-` dashes e.g. [name attribute](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/fa598ca88221555abcbe54a52f0738ca20d48f59/environments/prod.tfvars#L17)

Few key things:

- Do not use dashes with `${shuttername}` as storage accounts doesn't allow it.
- Use the first 8 characters only, of the `name` attribute from the env.tfvar file e.g. If the `name` attribute in env.tfvars file is `xui-manage-org` then ${shuttername} will be `xuimanag`.

Customized shutter pages can also be created/uploaded by following the below steps:

- Create a PR with:
    - Directories for your shutter page(s), e.g. mkdir sscscor 
    - Copy your static contents in sscscor/
    - Update the CODEOWNERS file with your teams folders and GitHub team
    - Make following changes in the [azure-pipelines.yml](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-shutter-pages/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml) file.

    ```
    sscscor:
      name: 'sscscor'
      shutter: 'sscscor' 
    ```
    Where:

    `shutter: 'sscscor'` shou ld be the name of the directory created in this repository with the static contents. 

Once the PR is reviewed and merged all the static contents will be uploaded to the respective storage accounts.

### Enable shutter with a DNS swap
Now everything is setup to render shutter page. Swap the DNS from Azure FrontDoor to Azure CDN endpoint with the following steps

- Clone the [azure-public-dns](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns) repository
- Lets assume this application need to be shuttered `www.decree-absolute.apply-divorce.service.gov.uk`
- Create a PR with the appropriate [prod zone](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-public-dns/blob/a24128ffdc47687937cbab37aaa46040786c7955/environments/prod/apply-divorce-service-gov-uk.yml#L41)
- The above contents will be updated as follows:

```
- name: "www.decree-absolute"
  ttl: 300
  record: "hmcts-prod.azurefd.net"
  shutter: true
```

`shutter: true` will enable the shutter page and redirect all the traffic to Azure CDN. 
`shutter: false` will disable the shutter page and redirect all the traffic back to Azure Frontdoor.
