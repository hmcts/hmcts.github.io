This page lists the external Public IP addresses used by the Palo Alto firewalls in the Azure platform.

Within the Azure Platform, the networking of each virtual network will follow a hub/spoke model. Depending on the environment, it will be connected to one of three network hubs: sandbox, nonprod or Production. 

The below table lists the IP addresses used by the Palo Alto firewalls in each hub.

|  Hub Environment | IP Address |
|-|-|
| Sandbox |20.49.137.196,20.49.137.7|
| Nonprod |20.49.168.141,20.49.168.17|
| Production |20.50.108.242,20.50.109.148|

CFT & SDS AKS environments, this table shows which Hub environment they are connected to: 

|CFT Environment|SDS Environment| Hub Environment |
