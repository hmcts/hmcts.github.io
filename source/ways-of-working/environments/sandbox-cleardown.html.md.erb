### What is this for?
The sandbox cleardown repo contains pipelines and scripts to remove resources from the sandbox environment based on resource tags in Azure.

All resources in the sandbox environment will have an expiresAfter tag with a date value.

Any resources that have an expiresAfter tag value dated in the past, based on the script runtime, will be deleted.

This ensures resources that are not required long term are removed.

###  The expiresAfter tag

In the Sandbox environment resources must be tagged with an end date after which they are no longer needed.
They will then be automatically deleted after this date.

By default a tag will be added as `now() + 30 days`.

You can customise this by setting an explicit date:

```terraform
module "tags" {
  source      = "git::https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-common-tags.git?ref=master"
  environment = var.env
  product     = var.product
  builtFrom   = var.builtFrom
  expiresAfter = "2023-01-01" # YYYY-MM-DD
}
```

Or by setting it to never expire with a date far into the future:

```terraform
module "tags" {
  source      = "git::https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-common-tags.git?ref=master"
  environment = var.env
  product     = var.product
  builtFrom   = var.builtFrom
  expiresAfter = "3000-01-01" # never expire
}
```

###  Sandbox Cleardown Channel
The '#sandbox-cleardown' slack channel has been created to post warning messages and on resources that are scheduled to be cleared down in the sandbox environment.

Once a resource has been deleted, an alert will posted in the channel.

See timelines below:

| Alert Type | Timeline |
|-|-|
| Resource will be Deleted | 5 days prior until day of deletion |
| Deleted Resource | Day of deletion |
| Unable to Delete Resource | Day of deletion |
