## Overview
This guide walk-through the process of deploying an Sample Java application in Cloud Platform.

Before working through the tutorial, we recommend reading following pages and assume you have all the required accounts.

- https://hmcts.github.io/onboarding
- https://hmcts.github.io/ways-of-working/

This guide uses a pre-configured application from an template which can be deployed from [Backstage](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/). Application is deployed to AKS(kubernetes) cluster inside `labs` namespace in sbox/sandbox environment.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following are installed on your local system.

- Docker
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Steps

1) Access [Backstage](https://backstage.platform.hmcts.net/create) to create a new github repo containing application template. Please make sure name of  Github repo  starts with `labs*`. This enables Jenkins build tool to organize the folder based on Github repo names.

2) Create `Jenkinsfile_parameterized`  file in the repo with following contents.

	#!groovy

	@Library("Infrastructure")

	def type = "java"
	def product = "labs"
	def component = ""   #githubreponame without "labs" prefix

	withPipeline(type, product, component) {
	}


3) Create Helm values file with following contents.

   CFT: values.sandbox.template.yaml

   SDS: values.sbox.template.yaml


	java:
	  # Don't modify below here
	  image: ${IMAGE_NAME}
	  ingressHost: ${SERVICE_FQDN}


4) Get the PR reviewed and merged.

5) Login to Jenkins and select "HMCTS-Labs" folder. Scan the organization by clicking on `Scan Organization Now`. New repository should be listed under repositires after scan finishes. Logs can be moinitored under `Scan Organization Log`. Any github repos that starts with `labs*` will be listed as part of this scan.

   CFT: [jenkins](https://sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net)

   SDS: [jenkins](https://sds-sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net)

6) Run the jenkins pipeline against the `master` branch.

7) We load balance across AKS clusters using `Azure Application Gateway`. Add couple of lines of config for the application.

   CFT:  [config file](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/master/environments/sbox/backend_lb_config.yaml)

   SDS:  [config file](https://github.com/hmcts/sharedservices-azure-platform/blob/master/environments/sbox/backend_lb_config.yaml)

      #labs
          - product: "labs"
            component:     #githubreponame without "labs" prefix

8) Azure Front Door is our entry point in HMCTS. Add following line of code for the app.

   CFT: [config file](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/blob/master/environments/sbox/sbox.tfvars)

     {
        product          = "labs"
        name             = "#githubreponame without "labs" prefix"
        custom_domain    = "your-app.service.core-compute-sandbox.internal"
        backend_domain   = ["firewall-sbox-int-palo-sbox.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com"]
        certificate_name = "wildcard-sandbox-platform-hmcts-net"
      }

   SDS: [config file](https://github.com/hmcts/sharedservices-azure-platform/blob/master/environments/sbox/sbox.tfvars)


       {
        product          = "labs"
        name             = "#githubreponame without "labs" prefix"
        custom_domain    = "your-app.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net"
        backend_domain   = ["firewall-sbox-int-palo-sdsapimgmt.uksouth.cloudapp.azure.com"]
        certificate_name = "wildcard-sandbox-platform-hmcts-net"
      }


9) We practise [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) for application deployment to Kubernetes.
