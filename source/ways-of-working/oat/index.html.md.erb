This covers details on the Operational Acceptance Testing performed by Platform Operations for a change to go into production.

## Objectives

- Check that the service/update has been tested thoroughly so that when it goes live, it has got the best chance of success.
- Facilitate the maintenance of the product by having comprehensive documentation of how it is built, used, and supported.
- Dev teams/ Platform Operations to be confident that in an event of production incident on the service, they have everything needed to assess and mitigate the issue.

## Do i need a OAT for my change ?

- Though Platform Operations do not OAT every change, it is development team's responsibility to make sure even a small code change complies with OAT objectives and criteria.
- Major releases that goes through Release Management should add details on Impact Analysis why the release should/ shouldn't need specific OAT from platops.
- Some examples when platops would mandate a OAT:
     1. New component [Component](/glossary/#component) being added. It could be a simple Job/ Function.
     2. Changes which has performance or security impact. This is usually assessed early in release cycle to check the need for Perftest, ITHC.
     3. New integration being added to existing [Component](/glossary/#component).
     4. Infrastructure changes or additions to a [Product](/glossary/#product)/[Component](/glossary/#component)


## How do i ask for a OAT ?

- Requests comes through Release Management.
- Release Management have a set of OAT tasks on the release JIRA.
- Development team need to assess and comment on each of the OAT tickets on how the changes made are compliant with the criteria on OAT tasks. Refer [OAT Tasks and recommendations](#oat-tasks-and-recommendations) for more guidance .
- Once all tickets and [Service Operations Guide](#service-operations-guide) have been updated, Release management will create a JIRA ticket for Platform Operations to validate the OAT tasks.


## OAT Tasks and recommendations

This section covers the tasks in OAT and some generic recommendations to ensure the service is compliant with OAT criteria.

`Please note these are generic recommendations and may vary from service to service based on application design`


### Service Operations Guide

Service Operations Guide (SOG) is a living document for each service that should be updated whenever there are relevant changes irrespective of the size of the change.

Below are some example SOGs on Confluence:

- [IA Tech Team: Service Operations Guide](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1274250278)
- [PCQ Service Operations Guide](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/PCQ/PCQ+Service+Operations+Guide)
