The common pipeline is a Jenkins pipeline defined by [code](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-library)
which implements Continuous Delivery to production while enforcing a standard set of 
checks on the code processed. 

It enables HMCTS Reform to deploy changes to the platform in a well defined 
manner providing the confidence that all the test and verification 
stages have been executed in a structured and repeatable sequence. 
This allows for fast feedback to developers to improve code development velocity. 

The delivery pipeline combines infrastructure and database schema changes with the 
application deployment, therefore taking advantage of the microservices architecture 
in use at HMCTS.

Code changes are subjected to a round of static tests - consisting of unit tests, static 
code analysis and security checks - before being deployed to a non-prod environment in a 
non-publicly accessible AKS (Kubernetes) deployment. Here, a range of smoke tests and 
non-destructive functional tests verifies the app is functioning. At this point a promotion 
process is started which labels the Docker image produced by the previous stages of the 
pipeline as production-ready. Production deployments are managed by flux which takes care 
of keeping an application deployment up to date with the latest production-ready image generated 
by the delivery pipeline.

Smoke tests are available in production as part of a flux deployment and run from a separate container.  

The entire Delivery Pipeline is a hands-off, automated process, triggered at the point of change. Code merged 
to master is deployed to production without any further human intervention. For this reason:

- PRs need to be carefully reviewed
- Feature Flagging, to separate the deployment of changes from their activation, is a practical necessity for all apps.

### More information

For an in-depth guide on how the common pipeline works and how it should be used, please refer to the [cnp-jenkins-library README](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-library/blob/master/README.md)

### Deploying applications using the common pipeline

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is the package manager for Kubernetes. 
We deploy all of our applications using a helm chart to Kubernetes.
For more information about Helm, please see the related new component 
[docs](../new-component/helm-chart.html)

![The Common Pipeline](/images/common-pipeline.png)

The diagram below shows the end to end workflow of how an application is deployed throughout the SDLC, Perftest is an example of a non path to live environment that is _optionally_ deployed to.

An application consists of the different infrastructure levels of platform, product and component as detailed in [Infrastructure levels](/ways-of-working/new-component/infrastructure-as-code.html#infrastructure-levels).

The product and component levels are combined to define the name of the application, denoted by app-name in the diagram below. The values for product and component should be defined in the Jenkinsfile within the github repo.

Example: [cnp-plum-frontend](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-plum-frontend/blob/master/Jenkinsfile_CNP)

The environments shown in the diagram reflect CFT. Review the table below to see the corresponding SDS environment names.

|CFT Environment|SDS Environment|

![AKS Release](/images/aks-release.png)

End to end process:

1. Commit changes to feature branch
2. Create a pull request
3. Jenkins will push an image with tag
4. Jenkins will force a new Helm release to AKS
5. Jenkins will run automated tests
6. Merging and closing the PR will merge the feature with master
7. The merge with master will trigger a webhook to start the Jenkins pipeline
8. Jenkins will push an image with tag
9. Jenkins will force a new Helm release to AKS
10. Jenkins will run automated tests
11. Jenkins will destroy the pod
12. Jenkins will promote the image by:
    - retagging the image in ACR
    - updating the github flux repo with the new image name
13. Flux will see new changes and deploy new pod

### Finding your pipeline

Within Jenkins, there exists the concept of organisation folders. This enables Jenkins to scan a GitHub Organization to discover repositories and automatically create managed pipelines for them.

Your pipeline will exist within a specific organisation folder which should have been defined when the pipeline integration was first configured.

See Step 4 of [Jenkins Onboarding](/onboarding/team/jenkins.html) for details.

### Finding your application

Within AKS, your application pods will exist within a namespace. The namespace will correspond to what has been configured in the Jenkins team-config.yml file.

[CFT example](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-config/blob/4172d1409ec33072a867dee75fb8bb15192961e0/team-config.yml#L3)

[SDS example](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-jenkins-config/blob/edda067f268fe4056c19963fc5c7419cbd559856/team-config.yml#L3)

### Troubleshooting build issues

See [troubleshooting issues](../troubleshooting/). 

### Tips and Tricks

#### How to get to the Test URL

1. Click 'Show environments'
2. Click 'View deployment'

e.g. [hmcts/pip-frontend#79:](https://github.com/hmcts/pip-frontend/pull/79)

### Cannot find default branch

You may get the error below, when the pipeline has not ran on the master/main branch first.

When you run it on the master/main branch it will setup the default branch and then the pull request build will start working.

```
[2021-09-16T10:59:54.154Z] Execution failed for task ':sonarqube'.
[2021-09-16T10:59:54.154Z] > Could not find a default branch to fall back on.
```
