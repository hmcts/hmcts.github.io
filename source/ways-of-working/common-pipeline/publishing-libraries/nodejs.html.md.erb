For publishing NodeJs libraries, we use NPM as our package manager and GitHub Actions to publish the libraries.

## Publishing with NPM

[https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry)

## Using the Github Action

1. Go to your repository within GitHub
2. Select the Actions tab at the top
3. Select 'New workflow'
4. Scroll down and select 'Publish Node.js Package' pressing the 'Set up this workflow' button
5. On the far right select 'Start commit'
6. Update the PR name, then select 'Commit new file'
7. Pull your feature branch
