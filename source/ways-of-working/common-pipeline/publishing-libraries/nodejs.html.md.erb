For publishing Node.js libraries, we use NPM as our package manager and GitHub Actions to publish the libraries.

## Publishing

> All libraries are published under the `hmcts` scope, make sure your library name starts with `@hmcts/my-lib`, see [nodejs-logging](https://github.com/hmcts/nodejs-logging/blob/28eedc42475b06dce207ecc4dc86c4ceaea39a89/package.json#L2)

1. Go to your repository within GitHub
2. Select the Actions tab at the top
3. Select 'New workflow'
4. Scroll down to the 'Workflows created by HM Courts & Tribunals Service' section and select 'Publish Node.js Library' pressing the 'Set up this workflow' button
5. On the far right select 'Start commit'
6. Update the pull request name, then select 'Commit new file'
7. Pull your feature branch
8. Create a release in GitHub
9. Check the workflow build in the Actions tab
10. Check the library was released to [https://npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)
